1
01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:06.370
Fear. Treachery Bloodlust.

2
01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:08.340
Thousands of years ago,

3
01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:11.808
these were the forces
that ruled our world.

4
01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:14.884
A world where prey
were scared of predators.

5
01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:20.207
And predators had an uncontrollable,
biological urge...

6
01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:22.567
to maim, and maul, and...

7
01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:27.521
Blood! Blood! Blood!

8
01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:36.727
And death.

9
01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:45.766
Back then, the world was divided in two.

10
01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:46.967
Vicious predator...

11
01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:49.524
or meek prey.

12
01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:56.001
But over time, we evolved.

13
01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:59.801
And moved beyond our primitive,
savage ways.

14
01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:03.851
Now, predator and prey live in harmony.

15
01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:08.884
And every young mammal has
multitudinous opportunities.

16
01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:10.007
Yeah.

17
01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:13.528
I don't have to cower in a herd anymore.

18
01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:17.082
Instead, I can be an astronaut.

19
01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:22.443
I don't have to be
a lonely hunter anymore.

20
01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:24.967
Today, I can hunt for tax exemptions.

21
01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:27.845
I'm gonna be an actuary!

22
01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:32.284
And I can make the world a better place.

23
01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:34.044
I am going to be...

24
01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.889
a police officer!

25
01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:44.724
Bunny cop? That is the most
stupidest thing I ever heard.

26
01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:47.565
It may seem impossible to small minds...

27
01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:50.371
I'm looking at you, Gideon Grey.

28
01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:53.405
But, just 211 miles away...

29
01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:57.121
stands the great city of Zootopia!

30
01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:00.642
Where our ancestors
first joined together in peace...

31
01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:07.160
and declared that anyone can be anything!

32
01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:11.002
Thank you and good night!

33
01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:15.331
Judy, you ever wonder how your mom
and me got to be so darn happy?

34
01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:16.367
Nope.

35
01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:19.171
Well, we gave up on our dreams
and we settled. Right, Bon?

36
01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:21.567
Oh, yes, that's right, Stu.
We settled hard.

37
01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:24.604
See, that's the beauty
of complacency, Jude.

38
01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:27.081
If you don't try anything new,
you'll never fail.

39
01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:28.651
I like trying actually.

40
01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:30.245
What you father means, hon...

41
01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:31.925
is it's gonna be difficult,

42
01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:34.401
impossible even,
for you to become a police officer.

43
01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:37.086
Right. There's never been a bunny cop.
Bunnies don't do that.

44
01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:38.321
- Never.
- Never.

45
01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:41.328
Then, I guess I'll have to be
the first one.

46
01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:46.122
Because I am gonna make the world
a better place.

47
01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:50.171
Or, heck, you know, you want to talk
about making the world a better place...

48
01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:52.089
no better way to do it than
becoming a carrot farmer.

49
01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:54.208
Yes! Your dad, me...

50
01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:58.450
your 275 brothers and sisters.
We're changing the world!

51
01:03:58.600 --> 01:03:59.487
One carrot at a time.

52
01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:02.405
Amen to that.
Carrot farming is a noble profession.

53
01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:04.731
Just putting the seeds in the ground.

54
01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:07.451
At one with the soil.
Just getting covered in dirt.

55
01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:09.290
You get it, honey.
It's great to have dreams.

56
01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:12.330
Yeah. Just as long as you don't
believe in them too much.

57
01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.161
Where'd the heck she go?

58
01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:18.009
Give me your tickets right now...

59
01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:20.811
or I'm gonna kick
your meek little sheep butt.

60
01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:22.605
Cut it out, Gideon!

61
01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:25.205
What are you gonna do? Cry?

62
01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:26.088
Hey!

63
01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:28.328
You heard her. Cut it out.

64
01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:30.363
Nice costume, loser.

65
01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:32.420
What crazy world are you living in

66
01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:34.921
where you think a bunny could be a cop?

67
01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:37.242
Kindly return my friend's tickets.

68
01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:38.322
Come and get them.

69
01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:40.460
But watch out, because I'm a fox,

70
01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:42.688
and like you said
in your dumb little stage play...

71
01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:45.201
us predators used to eat prey.

72
01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:47.687
And that killer instinct
is still in our "Dunnah."

73
01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:49.968
I'm pretty much sure
it's pronounced "DNA."

74
01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:51.690
Don't tell me what I know, Travis.

75
01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:53.683
You don't scare me, Gideon.

76
01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:57.802
- You scared now?
- Look at her nose twitch!

77
01:04:57.920 --> 01:04:58.807
She is scared!

78
01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:00.769
Cry little baby bunny.

79
01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:01.683
Cry, cry...

80
01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:07.481
You don't know when to quit, do you?

81
01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:16.444
I want you to remember this moment...

82
01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:20.340
the next time you think you will ever
be anything more than just a stupid...

83
01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:22.442
carrot-farming, dumb bunny.

84
01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:28.681
That looks bad.

85
01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:30.330
Are you okay, Judy?

86
01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:32.642
Yeah. I'm okay.

87
01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:34.521
Here you go.

88
01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:36.444
Wow! You got our tickets!

89
01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:37.965
You're awesome, Judy!

90
01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:41.522
Yeah, that Gideon Grey doesn't
know what he's talking about.

91
01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:43.728
Well, he was right about one thing.

92
01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:49.489
I don't know when to quit.

93
01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:52.121
Listen up, cadets.

94
01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:56.285
Zootopia has 12 unique ecosystems
within its city limits.

95
01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:57.561
Tundratown...

96
01:05:57.760 --> 01:05:58.921
Sahara Square...

97
01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:00.764
Rainforest District, to name a few.

98
01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:03.180
You're gonna have to master all of them

99
01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:05.681
before you hit the streets, or guess what?

100
01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:07.769
You'll be dead!

101
01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:10.848
Scorching sandstorm!

102
01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:14.605
You're dead, Bunny Bumpkin!

103
01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:17.607
1,000-foot fall!

104
01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:20.483
You're dead, Carrot Face!

105
01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:22.445
Frigid ice wall!

106
01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:25.920
You're dead, Farm Girl!

107
01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:28.603
Enormous criminal.

108
01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:32.011
You're dead. Dead, dead, dead!

109
01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:42.329
Filthy toilet! You're dead, Fluff Butt.

110
01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:45.161
Just quit and go home, fuzzy bunny!

111
01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:46.481
There's never been a bunny cop.

112
01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:47.607
- Never.
- Never.

113
01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:50.451
Just a stupid, carrot-farming dumb bunny,

114
01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:20.524
As mayor of Zootopia,
I am proud to announce...

115
01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:23.963
that my Mammal Inclusion Initiative
has produced...

116
01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:26.845
its first police academy graduate.

117
01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:32.325
Valedictorian of her class,
ZPD's very first rabbit officer...

118
01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:34.403
Judy Hopps.

119
01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:36.005
Oh, gosh.

120
01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:40.125
Assistant Mayor Bellwether, her badge.

121
01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:41.810
- Oh, yes. Right!
- Thank you.

122
01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:43.246
Yay, Judy!

123
01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:44.168
Judy...

124
01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:48.401
it is my great privilege
to officially assign you...

125
01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:51.683
to the heart of Zootopia: Precinct One.

126
01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:53.001
City Center.

127
01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:56.643
Congratulations, Officer Hopps.

128
01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:00.522
I won't let you down. This has been
my dream since I was a kid.

129
01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:03.287
It's a real proud day for us little guys.

130
01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:04.526
Bellwether, make room, will you? Come on.

131
01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:07.526
Okay, Officer Hopps.
Let's see those teeth!

132
01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:09.364
- Officer Hopps, right here!
- Look this way please!

133
01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:10.601
Hold still. Smile!

134
01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:14.725
We're real proud of you, Judy.

135
01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:16.370
Yeah. Scared, too.

136
01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:18.807
Really, it's kind of a proud-scared combo.

137
01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:22.567
I mean, Zootopia. So far away.
Such a big city.

138
01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:23.562
Guys...

139
01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:25.768
I've been working for this my whole life.

140
01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:29.242
We know. And we're just
a little excited for you, but terrified.

141
01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:32.121
The only thing we have to fear
is fear itself.

142
01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:34.766
And also bears.
We have bears to fear, too.

143
01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.286
Say nothing of lions and wolves.

144
01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:37.481
- Wolves?
- Weasels.

145
01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:38.641
You play cribbage with a weasel.

146
01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:39.926
And he cheats like there's no tomorrow.

147
01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:43.250
You know what, pretty much all
predators. And Zootopia's full of them.

148
01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:44.083
Oh, Stu.

149
01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:45.730
And foxes are the worst.

150
01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:50.005
Actually, your father does have
a point there. It's in their biology.

151
01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:51.446
Remember what happened with Gideon Grey?

152
01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:53.125
When I was nine.

153
01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:56.289
Gideon Grey was a jerk
who happened to be a fox.

154
01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:58.368
I know plenty of bunnies who are jerks.

155
01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:01.131
Sure, we all do. Absolutely.
But just in case...

156
01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:03.402
we made you a little care package
to take with you.

157
01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:05.648
- And I put some snacks in there.
- This is fox deterrent.

158
01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:06.847
Yeah, that's safe, to have that.

159
01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:08.445
This is fox repellent.

160
01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:09.567
The deterrent and the repellent,
that's all she needs.

161
01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:11.648
- Check this out!
- For goodness sake.

162
01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:13.580
She has no need for a fox Taser, Stu.

163
01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:15.921
Come on. When is there not
a need for a fox Taser?

164
01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:18.845
Okay, look! I will take this,
to make you stop talking.

165
01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:20.644
Terrific! Everyone wins!

166
01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:23.366
Arriving, Zootopia Express.

167
01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:28.020
Okay, gotta go! Bye!

168
01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:29.929
Bye, Judy!

169
01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:38.049
I love you guys.

170
01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:40.040
Love you, too.

171
01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.809
Oh, cripes, here come the waterworks.

172
01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:44.520
Oh, Stu, pull it together.

173
01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:46.371
Bye, everybody!

174
01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:47.721
- Bye-bye, Judy!
- Bye, Judy!

175
01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:49.490
I love you!

176
01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:51.882
Bye! Bye!

177
01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:55.961
Goodbye!

178
01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:29.165
I messed up tonight
I lost another fight

179
01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:33.002
Lost to myself
But I'll just start again

180
01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:35.362
I keep falling down

181
01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:37.642
I keep on hitting the ground

182
01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:39.410
But I always get up now

183
01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:41.483
To see what's next

184
01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:45.660
Birds don't just fly

185
01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:47.728
They fall down and get up

186
01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:57.891
Nobody learns without getting it wrong

187
01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:02.008
I won't give up
No I won't give in

188
01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:06.100
Till I reach the end
And then I'll start again

189
01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:08.260
No I won't leave

190
01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:14.811
I want to try everything
I want to try even though I could fail

191
01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:18.620
I won't give up
No, I won't give in

192
01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:20.404
Till I reach the end

193
01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:22.881
Then I'll start again

194
01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:27.404
No, I won't leave I want to try everything

195
01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:31.201
I want to try even though I could fail

196
01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:36.521
Try everything

197
01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:40.931
Try everything

198
01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:45.524
Try everything

199
01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:56.370
I'll keep on making those new mistakes

200
01:11:57.560 --> 01:12:04.284
And I'll keep on making them every day

201
01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:09.241
Those new mistakes

202
01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:25.121
Try everything

203
01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:29.129
Try everything

204
01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:33.204
Try everything

205
01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:41.405
Try everything

206
01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:45.881
I'm Gazelle. Welcome to Zootopia.

207
01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:48.481
Welcome to the Grand Pangolin Arms.

208
01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:51.450
Luxury apartments with charm.

209
01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:55.161
Complimentary delousing
once a month. Don't lose your key.

210
01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:56.651
Thank you.

211
01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:58.962
Hi! I'm Judy, your new neighbor.

212
01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:00.087
Yeah? Well, we're loud.

213
01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:02.402
Don't expect us to apologize for it.

214
01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:06.567
Greasy walls.

215
01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:08.046
Hey, shut up!

216
01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:09.122
Rickety bed.

217
01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:10.361
- You shut up!
- You shut up!

218
01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:11.447
Will you shut up?

219
01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.081
Crazy neighbors.

220
01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:14.321
I said, "Shut up!"

221
01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:15.851
I love it!

222
01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:17.166
Shut your mouth, shut up.

223
01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:36.362
Come on!

224
01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:38.329
He bared his teeth first!

225
01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:41.886
Excuse me.

226
01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:43.481
Down here.

227
01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:44.967
Hi.

228
01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:47.043
O-M-Goodness!

229
01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:50.170
They really did hire a bunny! What!

230
01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:53.210
I gotta tell you, you are even cuter
than I thought you'd be!

231
01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:58.602
You probably didn't know, but a bunny
can call another bunny "cute"...

232
01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:00.364
but when other animals do it...

233
01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:01.567
it's a little...

234
01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:06.241
I am so sorry! Me, Benjamin Clawhauser...

235
01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:10.564
the guy everyone thinks is just a flabby,
donut-loving cop, stereotyping you.

236
01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:15.286
No, it's okay. Oh, you've actually got...
There's a...

237
01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:16.726
In your neck. The fold.

238
01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:18.609
Where? Oh!

239
01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:21.604
There you went, you little dickens!

240
01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:24.729
I should get to roll call,
which way do I...?

241
01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:26.445
Bullpen's over there to the left.

242
01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:28.210
Great. Thank you.

243
01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:31.170
That poor little bunny's
gonna get eaten alive.

244
01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:45.808
Hey, Officer Hopps.

245
01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:47.803
You ready to make the world
a better place?

246
01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:53.247
Atten-hut!

247
01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:01.126
All right! Everybody sit.

248
01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:04.571
I've got three items on the docket.

249
01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:09.442
First... we need to acknowledge
the elephant in the room.

250
01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:11.127
Francine...

251
01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:13.161
Happy birthday.

252
01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:17.601
Number two.

253
01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:20.604
There are some new recruits
with us I should introduce...

254
01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:21.727
but I'm not going to....

255
01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:23.689
because I don't care.

256
01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:29.640
Finally, we have 14 missing mammal cases.

257
01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:33.640
All predators, from a giant polar bear
to a teensy little otter.

258
01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:37.881
And City Hall
is right up my tail to find them.

259
01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:41.323
This is priority number one.

260
01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:42.641
Assignments.

261
01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:44.126
Officers Grizzoli...

262
01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:45.300
Fangmeyer, Delgato.

263
01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:48.563
Your teams take missing mammals
from the Rainforest District.

264
01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:51.885
Officers McHorn, Rhinowitz, Wolfard.

265
01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:54.520
Your teams take Sahara Square.

266
01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:56.808
Officers Higgins, Snarlov, Trunkaby.

267
01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.889
Tundratown.

268
01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:01.850
And finally, our first bunny...

269
01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.571
Officer Hopps.

270
01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:06.401
Parking Duty.

271
01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:08.166
Dismissed.

272
01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:09.964
Parking duty?

273
01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:12.366
Chief!

274
01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:13.402
Chief Bogo?

275
01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:18.401
Sir, you said there were
14 missing mammal cases.

276
01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:20.085
- So?
- So, I can handle one.

277
01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:23.801
You probably forgot, but I was
top of my class at the Academy.

278
01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:26.407
Didn't forget. Just don't care.

279
01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:28.563
Sir, I'm not just some token bunny.

280
01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:31.564
Well, then writing 100 tickets a day
should be easy.

281
01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:38.485
100 tickets.
I'm not gonna write 100 tickets.

282
01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:40.762
I'm gonna write 200 tickets.

283
01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:42.046
Before noon.

284
01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:40.927
Boom!

285
01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:42.804
200 tickets before noon!

286
01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:49.161
201.

287
01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:53.520
Hey, watch where you're going, fox!

288
01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:22.363
Where'd he go?

289
01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:40.920
I don't know what you're doing
skulking around during daylight hours...

290
01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:45.444
but I don't want any trouble in here.
So, hit the road.

291
01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:47.220
I'm not looking
for any trouble either, sir.

292
01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:50.449
I simply want to buy a Jumbo Pop...

293
01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:52.090
for my little boy.

294
01:18:56.520 --> 01:18:58.887
You want the red or the blue, pal?

295
01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:05.605
I'm such a...

296
01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:06.642
Come on, kid. Back up.

297
01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:09.167
Listen, buddy. What? There aren't any
fox ice cream joints...

298
01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:10.407
in your part of town?

299
01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:11.641
No, no. There are.

300
01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:15.606
There are. It's just, my boy,
this goofy little stinker...

301
01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:18.770
he loves all things elephant.
Wants to be one when he grows up.

302
01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:20.846
Is that adorable?

303
01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:25.563
Who the heck am I to crush
his little dreams? Right?

304
01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:28.562
You probably can't read, fox,
but the sign says...

305
01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:31.883
"We reserve the right to refuse service...

306
01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:34.247
"...to anyone." So, beat it.

307
01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:36.442
You're holding up the line.

308
01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:41.287
Hello? Excuse me.

309
01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:44.404
You're gonna have to wait your turn
like everyone else, meter maid.

310
01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:46.369
Actually, I'm an officer.

311
01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:48.085
Just had a quick question.

312
01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:51.602
Are your customers aware
they're getting snot and mucus

313
01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:52.642
with their cookies and cream?

314
01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:56.130
What are you talking about?

315
01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:59.807
I don't want to cause you any trouble,
but I believe scooping ice cream...

316
01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.480
with an ungloved trunk
is a Class 3 health code violation.

317
01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:06.243
Which is kind of a big deal.

318
01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:08.323
Of course,
I could let you off with a warning...

319
01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:12.121
if you were to glove those trunks and,
I don't know...

320
01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:15.648
finish selling this nice dad
and his son a...

321
01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:16.767
What was it?

322
01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:19.002
A Jumbo Pop. Please.

323
01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:20.605
A Jumbo Pop.

324
01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:23.965
$15.

325
01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:27.130
Thank you so much. Thank you.

326
01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:30.523
Oh, no. Are you kidding me?
I don't have my wallet.

327
01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:35.490
I'd lose my head if it weren't attached
to my neck. That's the truth.

328
01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:39.440
Oh, boy. I'm sorry, pal.
Got to be about the worst birthday ever.

329
01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:41.807
Please don't be mad at me.

330
01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:43.611
Thanks anyway.

331
01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:51.164
Keep the change.

332
01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:53.288
Officer, I can't thank you enough.

333
01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:56.211
So kind, really. Can I pay you back?

334
01:20:56.400 --> 01:20:58.846
Oh, no, My treat. It just...

335
01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:00.620
You know, it burns me up to see folks

336
01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:02.961
with such backward attitudes toward foxes.

337
01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:05.970
I just wanna say
you're a great dad and just a...

338
01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:09.004
a real articulate fella.

339
01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:13.723
Well, that is high praise. It's rare that
I find someone so non-patronizing.

340
01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:14.642
Officer...

341
01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:16.006
Hopps. Mister...

342
01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:18.481
Wilde. Nick Wilde.

343
01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:20.005
And you, little guy...

344
01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:23.403
You want to be an elephant
when you grow up? You be an elephant.

345
01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:25.801
Because this is Zootopia.

346
01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:28.247
Anyone can be anything.

347
01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:30.886
Boy, I tell him that all the time.

348
01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:34.044
All right, here you go. Two paws. Yeah.

349
01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:37.170
Look at that smile.
That's a "happy birthday" smile.

350
01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:39.721
All right, give her a little
bye-bye toot-toot.

351
01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:42.246
Toot-toot!

352
01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:43.407
Bye, now.

353
01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:44.402
Goodbye!

354
01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:02.889
Hey, little Toot-Toot...

355
01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:52.090
Popsicles!

356
01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:53.605
Get your popsicles!

357
01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:19.767
Lumber delivery.

358
01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:20.961
What's with the color?

359
01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:22.121
The color?

360
01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:24.041
That's red wood.

361
01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:28.050
39, 40. There you go.

362
01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:30.609
Way to work that diaper, big guy.

363
01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:33.760
Hey, no kiss bye-bye for daddy?

364
01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:38.643
You kiss me tomorrow,
I'll bite your face off.

365
01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:40.801
Ciao.

366
01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:47.368
Well. I stood up for you,
and you lied to me.

367
01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:48.766
You liar!

368
01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:50.485
It's called a hustle, sweetheart.

369
01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:52.642
And I'm not the liar. He is.

370
01:23:56.480 --> 01:23:57.322
Hey!

371
01:23:57.480 --> 01:24:00.324
All right, slick Nick,
you're under arrest.

372
01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:01.800
Really? For what?

373
01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.367
Gee, I don't know.
How about selling food without a permit.

374
01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:06.602
Transporting undeclared commerce
across borough lines.

375
01:24:06.760 --> 01:24:07.841
False advertising.

376
01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.924
Permit. Receipt of declared commerce.

377
01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:13.321
And I didn't falsely advertise anything.
Take care.

378
01:24:13.480 --> 01:24:15.687
You told that mouse
the popsicle sticks were redwood!

379
01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:18.320
That's right. "Red wood."
With a space in the middle.

380
01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:19.845
Wood that is red.

381
01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:24.287
You can't touch me, Carrots.
I've been doing this since I was born.

382
01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:26.204
You're gonna want to refrain
from calling me Carrots.

383
01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:27.740
My bad. I just naturally assumed

384
01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:30.161
you came from some little
carrot-choked Podunk, no?

385
01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:31.083
No!

386
01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:33.641
Podunk is in Deerbrooke County,
and I grew up in Bunnyburrow.

387
01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:37.327
Okay. Tell me
if this story sounds familiar.

388
01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:39.926
Naive little hick with good grades
and big ideas...

389
01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:42.691
decides, "Hey, look at me!
I'm gonna move to Zootopia...

390
01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:45.844
where predators and prey
live in harmony and sing "Kumbaya."

391
01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:48.088
Only to find, whoopsie...

392
01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:51.363
we don't all get along. And that
dream of becoming a big city cop?

393
01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:55.047
Double whoopsie. She's a meter maid.
And, whoopsie number three-sie...

394
01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:57.282
no one cares about her or her dreams.

395
01:24:57.440 --> 01:24:59.488
And soon enough, those dreams die

396
01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:01.364
and our bunny sinks into emotional
and literal squalor...

397
01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:03.050
living in a box under a bridge...

398
01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:05.567
till finally she has no choice
but to go back home...

399
01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:08.200
with that cute, fuzzy-wuzzy little tail
between her legs...

400
01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:09.327
to become...

401
01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:11.005
You're from Bunnyburrow,
is that what you said?

402
01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:14.050
So how about a carrot farmer.
That sound about right?

403
01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:21.283
Be careful, now, or it won't just
be your dreams getting crushed.

404
01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:25.565
Hey! No one tells me
what I can or can't be!

405
01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:27.722
Especially not some jerk...

406
01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:32.403
who never had the guts to try to be
anything more than a popsicle hustler.

407
01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:36.087
All right, look.
Everyone comes to Zootopia...

408
01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:38.044
thinking they can be anything they want.

409
01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:39.611
Well, you can't.

410
01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:42.001
You can only be what you are.

411
01:25:42.200 --> 01:25:44.328
Sly fox, dumb bunny.

412
01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:46.324
I'm not a dumb bunny.

413
01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:49.806
Right. And that's not wet cement.

414
01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:52.726
You'll never be a real cop.

415
01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:55.120
You're a cute meter maid, though.

416
01:25:55.920 --> 01:25:57.649
Maybe a supervisor one day.

417
01:25:57.800 --> 01:25:59.723
Hang in there.

418
01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:23.807
You can't do nothing right, babe

419
01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:25.962
I'm a loser

420
01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:54.169
Oh, hey, it's my parents.

421
01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:55.845
Oh, there she is!

422
01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:56.762
Hi, sweetheart!

423
01:26:56.920 --> 01:26:59.685
Hey there, Jude the dude.
How was your first day on the force?

424
01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:01.842
- It was real great.
- Yeah?

425
01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:03.206
Everything you ever hoped?

426
01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:04.686
Absolutely.

427
01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:09.289
And more. Everyone's so nice and...

428
01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:10.851
- I feel like I'm making a difference.
- Wait a second.

429
01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:12.240
Holy cripes, Bonnie, look at that.

430
01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:13.965
Oh, my sweet heaven!

431
01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:16.128
Judy, are you a meter maid?

432
01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:18.727
This? No! Oh, no.
This is just a temporary thing.

433
01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:20.211
It's the safest job on the force!

434
01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:22.966
She's not a real cop.
Our prayers have been answered!

435
01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:25.367
- Glorious day!
- Meter maid! Meter maid!

436
01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:28.205
- Meter maid! Meter maid!
- Dad. Dad. Dad!

437
01:27:28.360 --> 01:27:30.044
It's been a really long day.
I should really...

438
01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:31.326
That's right, you get some rest.

439
01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:32.811
Those meters aren't gonna maid themselves.

440
01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:34.365
Bye-bye.

441
01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:36.690
Buh-bye.

442
01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:42.886
Hey, buddy, turn down
that depressing music.

443
01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:47.204
Leave the meter maid alone.
Didn't you hear her conversation?

444
01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:48.521
She feels like a failure!

445
01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:50.205
- Oh, shut up!
- You shut up!

446
01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:52.647
- You shut up!
- You shut up!

447
01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:54.564
Tomorrow's another day.

448
01:27:54.720 --> 01:27:57.007
Yeah, but it might be worse!

449
01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:01.403
I was 30 seconds over!

450
01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.002
You're a real hero, lady!

451
01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:08.881
My mommy says she wishes you were dead.

452
01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:13.207
Uncool, rabbit.
My tax dollars pay your salary.

453
01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:18.564
I am a real cop. I am a real cop.
I am a real cop.

454
01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:21.326
Hey, hey! You, bunny!

455
01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:25.371
Sir. If you have a grievance, you may
contest your citation in traffic court.

456
01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:27.409
What are you talking about? My shop!

457
01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:29.443
It was just robbed! Look!

458
01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:30.971
He's getting away!

459
01:28:31.080 --> 01:28:32.570
Are you a cop or not?

460
01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:35.525
Yes! Don't worry, sir! I've got this!

461
01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:41.845
Stop! Stop, in the name of the law!

462
01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:44.841
Catch me if you can, Cottontail!

463
01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:53.362
Coming through!

464
01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:55.249
This is Officer McHorn, we got a 10-31.

465
01:28:55.400 --> 01:28:56.526
I got dibs!

466
01:28:56.680 --> 01:28:58.125
Officer Hopps. I am in pursuit!

467
01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:16.530
You!

468
01:29:16.680 --> 01:29:17.488
Freeze!

469
01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:19.802
Hey, meter maid! Wait for the real cops!

470
01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:22.121
Stop!

471
01:29:49.960 --> 01:29:50.961
Sorry. Coming through.

472
01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:53.361
Excuse me. Excuse me. Pardon.

473
01:29:58.120 --> 01:29:59.246
Bon voyage-e, flat foot!

474
01:30:16.840 --> 01:30:18.330
Hey, stop right there!

475
01:30:18.440 --> 01:30:19.771
Have a donut, copper!

476
01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:25.002
Oh, my God. Did you see
those leopard print jeggings?

477
01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:32.611
I love your hair.

478
01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:34.201
Thank you.

479
01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:37.049
Come to papa.

480
01:30:40.040 --> 01:30:42.725
You're gonna have to be patient and
wait in line just like everyone else...

481
01:30:42.880 --> 01:30:44.928
Mrs. Otterton. Okay?

482
01:30:51.720 --> 01:30:53.722
I popped the weasel!

483
01:30:53.880 --> 01:30:55.644
Hopps!

484
01:30:57.680 --> 01:30:59.300
Abandoning your post.

485
01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:00.811
Inciting a scurry.

486
01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:02.923
Reckless endangerment of rodents.

487
01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:04.929
But, to be fair...

488
01:31:05.080 --> 01:31:08.641
you did stop a master criminal
from stealing two dozen moldy onions.

489
01:31:09.560 --> 01:31:12.006
Hate to disagree with you, sir,
but those aren't onions.

490
01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:14.885
Those are a crocus varietal
called midnicampum holicithias.

491
01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:16.286
They're a Class-C botanical, sir.

492
01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:19.006
I grew up in a family where
plant husbandry was kind of a thing.

493
01:31:19.160 --> 01:31:20.685
Shut your tiny mouth now!

494
01:31:21.600 --> 01:31:23.364
Sir, I got the bad guy.

495
01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:24.567
That's my job.

496
01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:27.849
Your job is putting tickets on parked cars!

497
01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.765
Chief, Mrs. Otterton's here
to see you again.

498
01:31:30.920 --> 01:31:31.842
Not now.

499
01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:33.286
Okay, I just didn't know
if you'd want to take it this time.

500
01:31:33.440 --> 01:31:34.407
She seems really upset.

501
01:31:34.560 --> 01:31:35.971
- Not now!
- Sir...

502
01:31:36.200 --> 01:31:39.966
I don't want to be a meter maid,
I want to be a real cop.

503
01:31:40.120 --> 01:31:43.886
Do you think the mayor asked me what
I wanted when he assigned you to me?

504
01:31:45.120 --> 01:31:46.246
But, sir, if...

505
01:31:46.440 --> 01:31:49.125
Life isn't some cartoon musical
where you sing a little song...

506
01:31:49.280 --> 01:31:52.727
and your insipid dreams
magically come true.

507
01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:55.645
So, let it go.

508
01:31:56.600 --> 01:31:59.763
Chief Bogo, please.
Five minutes of your time.

509
01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:00.967
I'm sorry, sir.

510
01:32:01.120 --> 01:32:03.248
I tried to stop her.
She is super-slippery.

511
01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:05.124
I gotta go sit down.

512
01:32:05.400 --> 01:32:08.643
Ma'am, as I've told you,
we're doing everything we can.

513
01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:12.600
My husband has been missing for
10 days. His name is Emmitt Otterton.

514
01:32:12.760 --> 01:32:13.807
Yes, I know.

515
01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:16.008
He's a florist.

516
01:32:16.200 --> 01:32:19.443
We have two beautiful children.
He would never just disappear.

517
01:32:19.680 --> 01:32:22.570
Ma'am, our detectives are very busy.

518
01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:26.770
Please. There's got to be someone
to find my Emmitt.

519
01:32:26.920 --> 01:32:27.728
Mrs. Otterton...

520
01:32:27.920 --> 01:32:28.887
I will find him.

521
01:32:30.640 --> 01:32:32.130
Thank you.

522
01:32:32.440 --> 01:32:35.330
Bless you. Bless you, little bunny.

523
01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:39.047
Take this.

524
01:32:39.200 --> 01:32:41.601
Find my Emmitt. Bring him home...

525
01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:43.683
to me and my babies, please.

526
01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:46.166
Mrs. Otterton, please wait out here.

527
01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:48.004
Of course. Thank you both so much.

528
01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:49.487
One second.

529
01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:52.684
You're fired.

530
01:32:52.840 --> 01:32:54.001
What? Why?

531
01:32:54.200 --> 01:32:55.531
Insubordination!

532
01:32:55.680 --> 01:32:57.364
Now. I'm going to open this door...

533
01:32:57.520 --> 01:33:00.330
and you're going to tell that otter
you're a former meter maid...

534
01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:02.642
with delusions of grandeur...

535
01:33:02.840 --> 01:33:04.524
who will not be taking the case!

536
01:33:04.640 --> 01:33:07.530
I just heard Officer Hopps
is taking the case.

537
01:33:07.680 --> 01:33:09.170
Assistant Mayor Bellwether.

538
01:33:09.280 --> 01:33:12.568
The Mammal Inclusion Initiative
is really starting to pay off.

539
01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:15.445
Mayor Lionheart is just gonna
be so jazzed!

540
01:33:15.560 --> 01:33:16.527
No, let's not tell the Mayor just yet.

541
01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:19.530
And I've sent it and it is done,
so I did do that.

542
01:33:19.720 --> 01:33:21.210
Well, I'd say the case is in good hands.

543
01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:24.011
Us little guys really need to
stick together, right?

544
01:33:24.360 --> 01:33:25.486
Like glue.

545
01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:27.047
Good one.

546
01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:29.168
Just call me
if you ever need anything, okay?

547
01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:31.089
You've always got a friend
at City Hall, Judy.

548
01:33:31.240 --> 01:33:32.685
All right, bye-bye.

549
01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:34.888
Thank you, ma'am.

550
01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:42.091
I will give you 48 hours.

551
01:33:42.240 --> 01:33:43.321
Yes!

552
01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:44.720
That's two days to find Emmitt Otterton.

553
01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:45.529
Okay.

554
01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:49.924
But, you strike out, you resign.

555
01:33:54.080 --> 01:33:55.241
Okay.

556
01:33:55.400 --> 01:33:56.287
Deal!

557
01:33:56.440 --> 01:34:00.240
Splendid. Clawhauser will
give you the complete case file.

558
01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:01.606
Here you go.

559
01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:03.210
One missing otter.

560
01:34:04.800 --> 01:34:05.801
That's it?

561
01:34:05.960 --> 01:34:09.123
Yikes! That is the smallest case file
I've ever seen.

562
01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:11.561
Leads, none. Witnesses, none.

563
01:34:11.680 --> 01:34:14.763
And you're not in the computer system
yet, so resources, none!

564
01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:19.082
I hope you didn't stake your career
on cracking this one!

565
01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:22.523
Okay. Last known sighting.

566
01:34:26.640 --> 01:34:28.961
Can I just borrow... Thank you.

567
01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:33.166
Popsicle?

568
01:34:33.280 --> 01:34:34.850
The murder weapon.

569
01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:36.490
Get your popsicle.

570
01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:40.326
Yeah. Because that... What does that mean?

571
01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:41.402
It means...

572
01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:44.760
I have a lead.

573
01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:52.805
Hi! Hello? It's me, again!

574
01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:54.962
Hey, it's Officer Toot-Toot.

575
01:34:56.080 --> 01:34:58.128
No. Actually, it's Officer Hopps...

576
01:34:58.280 --> 01:35:00.169
and I'm here to ask you some questions
about a case.

577
01:35:00.320 --> 01:35:02.766
What happened, meter maid?
Did someone steal a traffic cone?

578
01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:04.649
It wasn't me.

579
01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:10.171
Hey, Carrots, you're going to
wake the baby. I gotta get to work.

580
01:35:10.440 --> 01:35:11.521
This is important, sir.

581
01:35:11.680 --> 01:35:14.843
I think your $10 worth of popsicles
can wait.

582
01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:18.206
I make 200 bucks a day, Fluff!

583
01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:21.529
365 days a year, since I was 12.

584
01:35:21.720 --> 01:35:23.290
And time is money. Hop along.

585
01:35:23.440 --> 01:35:25.363
Please, just look at the picture.

586
01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:28.126
You sold Mr. Otterton that popsicle,
right? Do you know him?

587
01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:29.002
I know everybody.

588
01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:31.722
And I also know that, somewhere...

589
01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:32.980
there's a toy store
missing its stuffed animal,

590
01:35:33.080 --> 01:35:35.811
so why don't you get back to your box?

591
01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:37.689
Fine. Then we'll have to do this
the hard way.

592
01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:41.045
Did you just boot my stroller?

593
01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:43.049
Nicholas Wilde, you are under arrest.

594
01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:45.848
For what? Hurting your feelings?

595
01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:47.206
Felony Tax Evasion.

596
01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:53.210
Yeah, $200 a day, 365 days a year,
since you were 12.

597
01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:58.002
That's two decades, so times 20,
which is $1,460,000, I think.

598
01:35:58.160 --> 01:36:01.721
I mean, I am just a dumb bunny,
but we are good at multiplying.

599
01:36:01.880 --> 01:36:03.644
Anyway, according to your tax forms...

600
01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:06.485
you reported, let me see here... zero!

601
01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:10.930
Unfortunately, lying on a federal form
is a punishable offense.

602
01:36:11.080 --> 01:36:12.570
Five years jail time.

603
01:36:12.720 --> 01:36:14.927
Well, it's my word against yours.

604
01:36:15.880 --> 01:36:17.769
200 bucks a day, Fluff!

605
01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:20.605
365 days a year, since I was 12.

606
01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:22.649
Actually, it's your word against yours.

607
01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:26.207
And if you want this pen, you're going to
help me find this poor, missing otter...

608
01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:30.206
or the only place you'll be selling
popsicles is the prison cafeteria.

609
01:36:31.240 --> 01:36:33.083
It's called a hustle, sweetheart.

610
01:36:33.400 --> 01:36:35.402
She hustled you.

611
01:36:39.280 --> 01:36:42.170
She hustled you good!

612
01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:45.409
You a cop now, Nick.
You gonna need one of these.

613
01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:47.766
Have fun...

614
01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:48.967
working with the fuzz!

615
01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:52.645
Start talking.

616
01:36:53.280 --> 01:36:56.602
I don't know where he is.
I only saw where he went.

617
01:36:56.840 --> 01:36:57.762
Great. Let's go.

618
01:36:59.120 --> 01:37:01.122
It's not exactly a place for...

619
01:37:01.360 --> 01:37:02.441
a cute little bunny.

620
01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:04.568
Don't call me cute. Get in the car.

621
01:37:04.680 --> 01:37:06.603
Okay. You're the boss.

622
01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:27.011
Hi.

623
01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:28.121
Hello?

624
01:37:30.240 --> 01:37:31.446
Hello?

625
01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:33.569
Hello? Hello?

626
01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:38.170
Hello. My name is...

627
01:37:38.400 --> 01:37:41.483
You know, I'm going to hit
the pause button right there...

628
01:37:41.640 --> 01:37:43.881
because we're all good
on Bunny Scout cookies.

629
01:37:44.880 --> 01:37:45.927
No.

630
01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:48.367
I'm Officer Hopps, ZPD.

631
01:37:48.520 --> 01:37:52.286
I'm looking for a missing mammal,
Emmitt Otterton, right here...

632
01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:55.046
who may have frequented
this establishment.

633
01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:01.284
Yeah, old Emmitt.

634
01:38:02.520 --> 01:38:04.841
Haven't seen him in a couple of weeks.

635
01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:08.163
But, hey, you should talk
to his yoga instructor.

636
01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:10.004
I'd be happy to take you back.

637
01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:11.047
Thank you so much.

638
01:38:11.200 --> 01:38:13.540
I'd appreciate that more than
you can imagine, it would be such...

639
01:38:13.640 --> 01:38:14.766
You are naked!

640
01:38:15.240 --> 01:38:18.005
For sure, we're a naturalist club.

641
01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:21.448
Yeah. In Zootopia, anyone can be anything.

642
01:38:21.640 --> 01:38:23.483
These guys, they be naked.

643
01:38:23.640 --> 01:38:26.610
Nangi's just on the other side
of the Pleasure Pool.

644
01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:35.206
Oh, boy.

645
01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:37.209
Does this make you uncomfortable?

646
01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:40.762
Because if so, there is no
shame in calling it quits.

647
01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:42.928
Yes, there is.

648
01:38:43.080 --> 01:38:45.082
Boy, that's the spirit.

649
01:38:46.280 --> 01:38:49.363
Yeah, some mammals say
the naturalist life is weird...

650
01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:51.648
but you know what I say is weird?

651
01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:53.649
Clothes on animals!

652
01:38:54.360 --> 01:38:56.044
Here we go.

653
01:38:56.200 --> 01:39:00.888
As you can see, Nangi's an elephant,
so she'll totally remember everything.

654
01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:02.201
Hey, Nangi.

655
01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:05.609
These dudes have some questions
about Emmitt the otter.

656
01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:06.568
Who?

657
01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:10.042
Emmitt Otterton? Been coming to
your yoga class for like...

658
01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:11.571
6 years?

659
01:39:11.760 --> 01:39:13.330
I have no memory of this beaver.

660
01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:15.244
He's an otter, actually.

661
01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:17.124
He was here
a couple Wednesdays ago, remember?

662
01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:18.042
No.

663
01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:21.960
Yeah, he was wearing
a green cable-knit sweater vest...

664
01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:27.405
and a new pair of corduroy slacks.
And a paisley tie, sweet Windsor knot.

665
01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:29.449
Real tight. Remember that, Nangi?

666
01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:30.300
No.

667
01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:34.260
And we both walked him out,
and he got into this big old white car

668
01:39:34.360 --> 01:39:35.771
with a silver trim.

669
01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:38.725
Needed a tune-up.
The third cylinder wasn't firing.

670
01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:40.769
- Remember that, Nangi?
- No.

671
01:39:41.320 --> 01:39:45.689
You didn't happen to catch
the license plate number, did you?

672
01:39:45.880 --> 01:39:48.770
Oh, for sure. It was 2-9...

673
01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:50.684
T-H-D...

674
01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:52.729
- 0-3.
- 0-3. Wow.

675
01:39:52.840 --> 01:39:54.285
This is a lot of great info. Thank you.

676
01:39:54.440 --> 01:39:57.603
Told you Nangi has a mind
like a steel trap.

677
01:39:57.760 --> 01:40:01.810
I wish I had a memory like an elephant.

678
01:40:03.040 --> 01:40:05.168
Well, I had a ball.

679
01:40:05.320 --> 01:40:06.765
You are welcome for the clue...

680
01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:08.820
and seeing as how any moron
can run a plate,

681
01:40:08.920 --> 01:40:11.844
I will take that pen and bid you adieu.

682
01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:14.806
The plate. I can't run a plate.

683
01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:16.246
I'm not in the system yet.

684
01:40:16.640 --> 01:40:18.483
Give me the pen, please.

685
01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:20.131
What was it you said?

686
01:40:20.280 --> 01:40:22.282
"Any moron can run a plate"?

687
01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:27.202
Gosh. If only there were a moron around
who were up to the task.

688
01:40:27.400 --> 01:40:30.643
Rabbit, I did what you asked!
You can't keep me on the hook forever.

689
01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:35.010
Not forever. Well, I only have
36 hours left to solve this case.

690
01:40:35.200 --> 01:40:37.601
So can you run the plate or not?

691
01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:41.400
Actually, I just remembered...

692
01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:42.851
I have a pal at the DMV

693
01:40:44.160 --> 01:40:45.650
Flash is the fastest guy in there.

694
01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:47.484
If you need something done, he's on it.

695
01:40:47.600 --> 01:40:50.171
I hope so. We are really fighting
the clock and every minute counts.

696
01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:55.130
Wait. They're all sloths?

697
01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:25.010
You said this was going to be quick!

698
01:41:25.160 --> 01:41:28.289
Are you saying that because
he's a sloth, he can't be fast?

699
01:41:28.440 --> 01:41:30.886
I thought in Zootopia,
anyone could be anything.

700
01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:33.891
Flash, Flash, hundred-yard dash.
Buddy, it's nice to see you.

701
01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:37.009
Nice to...

702
01:41:37.880 --> 01:41:39.006
see you...

703
01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:41.561
too.

704
01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:44.007
Hey, Flash,
I'd love you to meet my friend.

705
01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:46.090
Darling, I've forgotten your name.

706
01:41:46.840 --> 01:41:49.411
Officer Judy Hopps, ZPD, how are you?

707
01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:50.891
I am...

708
01:41:51.400 --> 01:41:52.401
doing...

709
01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:54.405
just...

710
01:41:54.760 --> 01:41:55.727
Fine?

711
01:41:55.880 --> 01:41:58.042
...as well as...

712
01:41:58.240 --> 01:41:59.446
I can...

713
01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:00.762
be.

714
01:42:00.920 --> 01:42:02.206
- What...
- Hang in there.

715
01:42:02.360 --> 01:42:03.407
...can I...

716
01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:05.690
- do...
- I was hoping you could run a...

717
01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:06.841
...for you...

718
01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:08.087
Well, I was hoping you could...

719
01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:09.287
today?

720
01:42:12.040 --> 01:42:14.407
Well, I was hoping you could
run a plate for us.

721
01:42:14.560 --> 01:42:16.289
We are in a really big hurry.

722
01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:19.200
Sure.

723
01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:20.725
What's the...

724
01:42:21.240 --> 01:42:23.049
- plate...
- 2-9-T...

725
01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:24.326
...number?

726
01:42:25.200 --> 01:42:27.202
2-9-T-H-D-0-3

727
01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:37.441
Two...

728
01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:40.721
nine...

729
01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:43.248
T-H-D-0-3.

730
01:42:44.120 --> 01:42:45.281
...T...

731
01:42:46.080 --> 01:42:47.570
H-D-0-3.

732
01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:49.282
...H...

733
01:42:49.440 --> 01:42:51.442
D-0-3.

734
01:42:54.720 --> 01:42:55.607
...D...

735
01:42:55.800 --> 01:42:57.245
0-3.

736
01:42:58.760 --> 01:42:59.443
...0...

737
01:42:59.600 --> 01:43:00.726
3.

738
01:43:02.640 --> 01:43:04.130
Hey, Flash, want to hear a joke?

739
01:43:04.280 --> 01:43:05.281
No!

740
01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:06.761
Sure.

741
01:43:07.200 --> 01:43:11.285
Okay. What do you call
a three-humped camel?

742
01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:13.725
I don't...

743
01:43:13.880 --> 01:43:15.086
know.

744
01:43:15.240 --> 01:43:16.321
What...

745
01:43:16.440 --> 01:43:17.487
do...

746
01:43:17.640 --> 01:43:19.324
you call...

747
01:43:19.480 --> 01:43:21.403
- a...
- Three-humped camel.

748
01:43:21.560 --> 01:43:22.971
...three-humped...

749
01:43:23.160 --> 01:43:23.968
camel?

750
01:43:25.160 --> 01:43:26.161
Pregnant.

751
01:43:41.720 --> 01:43:43.085
Yes, very funny, very funny.

752
01:43:43.240 --> 01:43:44.480
Can we please just focus on the...

753
01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:46.100
- Hey...
- Wait, wait, wait!

754
01:43:46.200 --> 01:43:47.531
...Priscilla!

755
01:43:47.680 --> 01:43:48.841
Oh, no!

756
01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:51.330
Yes...

757
01:43:51.520 --> 01:43:53.140
Flash?

758
01:43:53.240 --> 01:43:54.002
What...

759
01:43:54.160 --> 01:43:55.002
do...

760
01:43:55.160 --> 01:43:56.844
- No!
- ...you call a...

761
01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.446
A three-humped camel? "Pregnant!"
Okay, great, we got it.

762
01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:02.001
...three... humped...

763
01:44:14.520 --> 01:44:16.170
- Here...
- Yeah. Hurry.

764
01:44:16.320 --> 01:44:18.368
- ...you...
- Thank you. "2-9-T-H-D-0-3."

765
01:44:18.520 --> 01:44:19.442
...go.

766
01:44:19.680 --> 01:44:22.001
It's registered to
Tundratown Limo Service.

767
01:44:22.160 --> 01:44:25.323
A limo took Otterton,
and the limo's in Tundratown!

768
01:44:25.480 --> 01:44:27.244
Way to hustle, bud. I love you. I owe you.

769
01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:29.203
Hurry! We gotta beat the rush hour, and...

770
01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:31.328
It's night?

771
01:44:32.440 --> 01:44:34.124
Closed. Great.

772
01:44:34.400 --> 01:44:38.200
And I will bet you
you don't have a warrant to get in.

773
01:44:38.400 --> 01:44:40.289
Darn it. It's a bummer.

774
01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:42.363
You wasted the day on purpose.

775
01:44:42.520 --> 01:44:44.220
Madam, I have a fake badge.

776
01:44:44.320 --> 01:44:46.721
I would never impede
your pretend investigation.

777
01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:52.046
It's not a pretend investigation. Look,
see? See him? This otter is missing.

778
01:44:52.520 --> 01:44:54.921
Then they should've gotten
a real cop to find him.

779
01:44:55.120 --> 01:44:56.281
What is your problem?

780
01:44:56.440 --> 01:44:58.300
Does seeing me fail
somehow make you feel better

781
01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:00.243
about your own sad, miserable life?

782
01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:02.448
It does. 100%.

783
01:45:02.640 --> 01:45:05.883
Now, since you're sans warrant...

784
01:45:06.040 --> 01:45:08.884
I guess we're... done?

785
01:45:10.560 --> 01:45:13.609
Fine. We are done. Here's your pen.

786
01:45:14.960 --> 01:45:15.609
Hey!

787
01:45:19.480 --> 01:45:21.005
First off, you throw like a bunny.

788
01:45:21.160 --> 01:45:24.687
Second, you're a very sore loser.
See you later, Officer Fluff.

789
01:45:24.840 --> 01:45:27.650
So sad this is over.
I wish I could've helped more.

790
01:45:27.800 --> 01:45:31.043
The thing is, you don't need a warrant
if you have probable cause...

791
01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:35.125
and I'm pretty sure I saw
a shifty lowlife climbing the fence.

792
01:45:35.320 --> 01:45:37.800
So you're helping plenty. Come on.

793
01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.651
2-9-T-H-D-0-3. This is it!

794
01:45:51.640 --> 01:45:52.766
Polar bear fur.

795
01:45:55.960 --> 01:45:57.405
- Oh, my God!
- What?

796
01:45:57.720 --> 01:46:00.291
The Velvety Pipes of Jerry Vole.

797
01:46:01.400 --> 01:46:02.526
But on CD.

798
01:46:02.680 --> 01:46:04.045
Who still uses CDs?

799
01:46:10.120 --> 01:46:14.409
Carrots, if your otter was here,
he had a very bad day.

800
01:46:16.040 --> 01:46:18.361
Those are claw marks.

801
01:46:19.080 --> 01:46:20.730
You ever seen anything like this?

802
01:46:20.920 --> 01:46:21.967
No.

803
01:46:22.480 --> 01:46:23.891
Wait, look.

804
01:46:26.080 --> 01:46:28.242
This is him, Emmitt Otterton.

805
01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:30.801
He was definitely here.

806
01:46:30.960 --> 01:46:33.122
What do you think happened?

807
01:46:35.840 --> 01:46:37.001
Now, wait a minute.

808
01:46:37.760 --> 01:46:41.765
Polar bear fur, Rat Pack music, fancy cup?

809
01:46:41.920 --> 01:46:42.967
I know whose car this is. We got to go.

810
01:46:43.720 --> 01:46:44.660
Why? Whose car is it?

811
01:46:44.760 --> 01:46:47.764
The most feared crime-boss
in Tundratown. They call him Mr. Big.

812
01:46:47.920 --> 01:46:50.400
And he does not like me. So we gotta go!

813
01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:52.369
I'm not leaving. This is a crime scene.

814
01:46:52.560 --> 01:46:54.847
It's gonna be an even bigger
crime scene if Mr. Big finds me here...

815
01:46:55.080 --> 01:46:56.366
so we're leaving right now.

816
01:46:58.000 --> 01:46:59.001
Raymond!

817
01:46:59.160 --> 01:47:01.208
And is that Kevin? Long time, no see.

818
01:47:01.760 --> 01:47:06.448
And, speaking of "no see,"
how about you forget you saw me?

819
01:47:06.600 --> 01:47:07.647
For old times' sake?

820
01:47:07.920 --> 01:47:08.887
That's a no.

821
01:47:22.840 --> 01:47:25.081
What did you do that made
Mr. Big so mad at you?

822
01:47:26.120 --> 01:47:28.885
I may have sold him
a very expensive wool rug...

823
01:47:29.040 --> 01:47:32.931
that was made from the fur of a skunk...

824
01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:35.122
's butt.

825
01:47:36.120 --> 01:47:38.407
Sweet cheese and crackers.

826
01:47:53.160 --> 01:47:54.525
Is that Mr. Big?

827
01:47:54.760 --> 01:47:55.761
No.

828
01:47:55.920 --> 01:47:57.081
What about him?

829
01:47:57.240 --> 01:47:58.401
- Is that him?
- No!

830
01:48:01.480 --> 01:48:02.481
That's got to be him.

831
01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:04.165
Stop talking, stop talking, stop talking!

832
01:48:13.480 --> 01:48:15.562
Mr. Big, sir. This is a simple...

833
01:48:17.280 --> 01:48:18.327
Yeah.

834
01:48:20.800 --> 01:48:22.529
This is a simple misunderstanding.

835
01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:27.447
You come here, unannounced, on the
day my daughter is to be married.

836
01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:29.602
Well, actually, we were brought here
against our will, so...

837
01:48:31.360 --> 01:48:33.567
The point is, I did not know
that it was your car...

838
01:48:33.760 --> 01:48:36.240
and I certainly did not know
about your daughter's wedding.

839
01:48:37.680 --> 01:48:39.364
I trusted you, Nicky.

840
01:48:39.520 --> 01:48:41.409
I welcomed you into my home.

841
01:48:41.600 --> 01:48:43.841
We broke bread together.

842
01:48:44.440 --> 01:48:46.488
Gram-mama made you a cannoli.

843
01:48:46.640 --> 01:48:48.768
And how did you repay my generosity?

844
01:48:48.920 --> 01:48:52.891
With a rug made from the butt of a skunk.

845
01:48:53.040 --> 01:48:54.849
A skunk-butt rug.

846
01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:56.570
You disrespected me.

847
01:48:56.720 --> 01:49:01.487
You disrespected my Gram-mama,
who I buried in that skunk butt rug.

848
01:49:03.040 --> 01:49:06.726
I told you never to show your face
here again but here you are...

849
01:49:06.920 --> 01:49:09.844
snooping around with this...

850
01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:11.286
What are you? A performer?

851
01:49:11.440 --> 01:49:12.601
What's with the costume?

852
01:49:12.760 --> 01:49:13.568
Sir. I am a...

853
01:49:13.760 --> 01:49:15.250
Mime! She is a mime.

854
01:49:15.400 --> 01:49:18.609
This... mime cannot speak.
You can't speak if you're a mime.

855
01:49:18.760 --> 01:49:20.000
No, I am a cop.

856
01:49:20.160 --> 01:49:21.810
And I'm on the Emmitt Otterton case.

857
01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:24.531
And my evidence puts him in your car.

858
01:49:24.680 --> 01:49:26.205
So intimidate me all you want.

859
01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:31.122
I'm going to find out what you did
to that otter if it's the last thing I do.

860
01:49:33.160 --> 01:49:36.050
Then I have only one request.

861
01:49:36.240 --> 01:49:39.642
Say hello to Gram-mama. Ice 'em.

862
01:49:41.280 --> 01:49:42.725
I didn't see nothing!
I'm not saying nothing!

863
01:49:42.920 --> 01:49:44.160
And you never will.

864
01:49:44.320 --> 01:49:45.731
Please! No, no, no!

865
01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.480
If you're mad at me about the rug,
I've got more rugs!

866
01:49:48.680 --> 01:49:52.651
Daddy! It's time for our dance!

867
01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:55.366
What did we say?

868
01:49:55.560 --> 01:49:57.642
No icing anyone at my wedding!

869
01:49:57.800 --> 01:50:00.246
I have to, baby. Daddy has to.

870
01:50:00.400 --> 01:50:01.322
Ice 'em.

871
01:50:01.480 --> 01:50:02.367
No, no no!

872
01:50:02.560 --> 01:50:03.527
Wait. Please!

873
01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:07.049
She's the bunny
that saved my life yesterday!

874
01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:08.486
From that giant donut.

875
01:50:08.640 --> 01:50:09.641
This bunny?

876
01:50:09.800 --> 01:50:11.484
Yeah! Hi!

877
01:50:11.680 --> 01:50:14.047
Hi. I love your dress.

878
01:50:14.680 --> 01:50:15.761
Thank you.

879
01:50:16.280 --> 01:50:17.281
Put 'em down.

880
01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:22.485
You've done me a great service.

881
01:50:22.640 --> 01:50:24.802
I will help you find the otter.

882
01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:29.927
I will take your kindness
and pay it forward.

883
01:50:57.880 --> 01:50:59.609
Otterton is my florist.

884
01:51:00.160 --> 01:51:02.527
He's like a part of the family.

885
01:51:02.720 --> 01:51:05.644
He had something important
he wanted to discuss.

886
01:51:05.800 --> 01:51:08.724
That's why I sent that car to pick him up.

887
01:51:09.440 --> 01:51:11.204
But he never arrived.

888
01:51:11.560 --> 01:51:13.130
Because he was attacked.

889
01:51:13.280 --> 01:51:15.806
No. He attacked.

890
01:51:16.280 --> 01:51:17.361
Otterton?

891
01:51:17.560 --> 01:51:20.689
Otterton. He went crazy.

892
01:51:20.840 --> 01:51:24.811
Ripped up the car,
scared my driver half to death...

893
01:51:24.960 --> 01:51:27.440
and disappeared into the night.

894
01:51:27.640 --> 01:51:30.769
But he's a sweet little otter.

895
01:51:31.800 --> 01:51:36.124
My child, we may be evolved,
but deep down...

896
01:51:36.280 --> 01:51:38.521
we are still animals.

897
01:51:40.640 --> 01:51:43.740
You want to find Otterton,
talk to the driver of that car.

898
01:51:43.840 --> 01:51:45.444
His name is Manchas...

899
01:51:45.640 --> 01:51:48.166
lives in the Rainforest District.

900
01:51:48.320 --> 01:51:50.800
Only he can tell you more.

901
01:51:54.600 --> 01:51:56.284
Mr. Manchas?

902
01:51:56.440 --> 01:51:58.488
Judy Hopps, ZPD.

903
01:51:58.680 --> 01:52:01.729
We just wanna know
what happened to Emmitt Otterton.

904
01:52:06.560 --> 01:52:07.641
You...

905
01:52:07.800 --> 01:52:09.006
should be asking...

906
01:52:09.960 --> 01:52:11.962
what happened to me.

907
01:52:13.120 --> 01:52:16.090
A teensy otter did that?

908
01:52:16.240 --> 01:52:17.571
What happened?

909
01:52:17.760 --> 01:52:19.569
He was an animal.

910
01:52:20.960 --> 01:52:21.882
Down...

911
01:52:22.280 --> 01:52:24.521
on all fours.

912
01:52:27.560 --> 01:52:28.971
He was a savage!

913
01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:40.921
There was no warning.

914
01:52:41.120 --> 01:52:43.327
He just kept yelling
about the Night Howlers.

915
01:52:44.160 --> 01:52:47.050
Over and over. The Night Howlers.

916
01:52:47.200 --> 01:52:50.602
So you know about the Night Howlers, too?

917
01:52:50.840 --> 01:52:52.171
Good. Good, good.

918
01:52:52.360 --> 01:52:56.922
Because the Night Howlers are exactly
what we are here to talk about.

919
01:52:57.080 --> 01:52:58.491
- Right?
- Yup.

920
01:52:59.240 --> 01:53:01.368
So, you just open the door...

921
01:53:01.520 --> 01:53:03.090
and tell us what you know...

922
01:53:03.280 --> 01:53:05.408
and we will tell you what we know. Okay?

923
01:53:07.040 --> 01:53:09.088
Okay.

924
01:53:10.120 --> 01:53:12.088
Clever fox.

925
01:53:15.760 --> 01:53:17.922
Mr. Manchas?

926
01:53:22.240 --> 01:53:23.082
Buddy?

927
01:53:23.240 --> 01:53:24.366
Are you...

928
01:53:24.480 --> 01:53:25.367
okay?

929
01:53:28.400 --> 01:53:29.925
Run. Run!

930
01:53:34.880 --> 01:53:36.006
What is wrong with him?

931
01:53:36.160 --> 01:53:37.525
I don't know!

932
01:53:42.480 --> 01:53:43.447
Jump!

933
01:53:46.080 --> 01:53:47.081
Come on!

934
01:53:52.080 --> 01:53:53.206
Head down!

935
01:53:55.200 --> 01:53:56.645
Officer Hopps to Dispatch.

936
01:53:56.800 --> 01:54:00.122
Are you familiar with Gazelle, greatest
singer of our lifetime, angel with horns?

937
01:54:00.280 --> 01:54:03.340
Okay, hold on. Keep watching.
Who's that beside her? Who is it?

938
01:54:03.440 --> 01:54:06.762
Wow, you are one hot dancer,
Benjamin Clawhauser.

939
01:54:08.360 --> 01:54:11.842
It's me! Did you think it was real?
It looks so real!

940
01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.685
It's not, it's just a new app.
Hold on a second.

941
01:54:14.840 --> 01:54:16.285
Clawhauser!

942
01:54:16.480 --> 01:54:20.371
Listen to me, we have a 10-91!
Jaguar gone savage!

943
01:54:20.480 --> 01:54:21.447
Vine and Tuh-junja!

944
01:54:21.600 --> 01:54:22.761
It's "Tuh-hunga!"

945
01:54:23.360 --> 01:54:24.930
Okay, we're sending backup! Hopps?

946
01:54:25.400 --> 01:54:26.845
Hopps!

947
01:54:28.520 --> 01:54:29.328
There!

948
01:54:29.440 --> 01:54:30.930
Head for the sky trams!

949
01:54:40.280 --> 01:54:41.930
Get in! Carrots.

950
01:54:42.080 --> 01:54:43.047
Carrots!

951
01:54:43.200 --> 01:54:44.042
Go!

952
01:54:45.440 --> 01:54:47.283
No, no, no!

953
01:54:47.440 --> 01:54:48.726
Buddy.

954
01:54:48.880 --> 01:54:50.689
One predator to another...

955
01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:56.809
Now, I can tell you're a little tense...

956
01:54:56.960 --> 01:54:58.644
so I'm just gonna give you
a little personal space!

957
01:55:05.360 --> 01:55:07.328
Rabbit, whatever you do, do not let go!

958
01:55:08.640 --> 01:55:10.420
- I'm gonna let go!
- No, you, what?

959
01:55:10.520 --> 01:55:12.522
One, two...

960
01:55:19.360 --> 01:55:22.045
Carrots. You saved my life.

961
01:55:22.200 --> 01:55:25.409
Well. That's what we do at the ZPD.

962
01:55:42.520 --> 01:55:44.568
Well, this should be good.

963
01:55:46.400 --> 01:55:49.365
I thought this was just a missing
mammal case but it's way bigger.

964
01:55:49.520 --> 01:55:51.648
Mr. Otterton did not just disappear.

965
01:55:51.800 --> 01:55:55.850
I believe he and this jaguar,
they went savage, sir.

966
01:55:56.000 --> 01:56:00.881
Savage? This isn't the Stone Age,
Hopps. Animals don't "go savage."

967
01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:04.083
I thought so, too, until I saw this.

968
01:56:06.200 --> 01:56:08.980
What? He was right here.

969
01:56:09.080 --> 01:56:10.605
The "savage" jaguar?

970
01:56:10.760 --> 01:56:13.660
Sir, I know what I saw.
He almost killed us!

971
01:56:13.760 --> 01:56:19.220
Or, maybe any aggressive predator
looks savage to you rabbits.

972
01:56:19.320 --> 01:56:20.242
Let's go!

973
01:56:20.400 --> 01:56:21.447
Wait, sir.

974
01:56:21.600 --> 01:56:23.500
I'm not the only one who saw him.

975
01:56:23.600 --> 01:56:24.840
Nick!

976
01:56:25.560 --> 01:56:27.483
You think I'm gonna believe a fox?

977
01:56:27.600 --> 01:56:29.340
He was a key witness, and I...

978
01:56:29.440 --> 01:56:31.660
Two days to find the otter...

979
01:56:31.760 --> 01:56:34.081
or you quit.

980
01:56:34.240 --> 01:56:35.969
That was the deal.

981
01:56:36.120 --> 01:56:37.645
Badge.

982
01:56:43.120 --> 01:56:44.929
- But, sir, we...
- Badge!

983
01:56:50.400 --> 01:56:51.890
No.

984
01:56:52.760 --> 01:56:54.380
What did you say, fox?

985
01:56:54.480 --> 01:56:58.020
Sorry. What I said was, "no."

986
01:56:58.120 --> 01:57:00.964
She will not be giving you that badge.

987
01:57:01.080 --> 01:57:04.846
Look, you give her a clown vest
and a three-wheeled joke-mobile...

988
01:57:04.960 --> 01:57:07.884
and two days to solve a case
you guys haven't cracked in two weeks?

989
01:57:08.760 --> 01:57:09.841
Yeah.

990
01:57:09.960 --> 01:57:11.485
No wonder she needed to get help
from a fox.

991
01:57:11.640 --> 01:57:13.802
None of you guys
were gonna help her, were you?

992
01:57:13.960 --> 01:57:15.325
Here's the thing, Chief.

993
01:57:15.440 --> 01:57:16.860
You gave her the 48 hours...

994
01:57:16.960 --> 01:57:18.962
so, technically, we still have...

995
01:57:19.160 --> 01:57:21.288
10 left to find our Mr. Otterton...

996
01:57:21.440 --> 01:57:23.761
and that is exactly what we're gonna do.

997
01:57:23.960 --> 01:57:28.284
So, if you'll excuse us, we have a very
big lead to follow and a case to crack.

998
01:57:28.440 --> 01:57:29.805
Good day.

999
01:57:35.520 --> 01:57:37.090
Officer Hopps.

1000
01:57:59.640 --> 01:58:01.210
Thank you.

1001
01:58:02.280 --> 01:58:04.681
Never let them see that they get to you.

1002
01:58:05.960 --> 01:58:07.200
So...

1003
01:58:07.360 --> 01:58:09.761
things do get to you?

1004
01:58:09.960 --> 01:58:12.361
No, I mean, not anymore...

1005
01:58:12.520 --> 01:58:16.525
but I was small and emotionally
unbalanced like you once.

1006
01:58:16.720 --> 01:58:17.687
Har-har.

1007
01:58:17.840 --> 01:58:19.808
No, it's true.

1008
01:58:19.960 --> 01:58:23.043
I think I was 8, or maybe 9...

1009
01:58:23.200 --> 01:58:28.180
and all I wanted to do
was join the Junior Ranger Scouts.

1010
01:58:28.280 --> 01:58:31.060
So, my mom scraped together enough money

1011
01:58:31.160 --> 01:58:33.561
to buy me a brand-new uniform...

1012
01:58:33.720 --> 01:58:36.291
because, by God, I was gonna fit in.

1013
01:58:36.440 --> 01:58:39.780
Even if I was the only predator
in the troop.

1014
01:58:39.880 --> 01:58:40.802
The only fox.

1015
01:58:40.960 --> 01:58:41.802
Okay, Nick.

1016
01:58:41.960 --> 01:58:43.564
I was gonna be part of a pack.

1017
01:58:43.680 --> 01:58:45.180
Ready for initiation?

1018
01:58:45.280 --> 01:58:47.140
Yeah. Pretty much born ready.

1019
01:58:47.240 --> 01:58:49.004
I was so proud.

1020
01:58:51.920 --> 01:58:52.728
Okay.

1021
01:58:52.880 --> 01:58:55.326
Now, raise your right paw
and deliver the oath.

1022
01:58:55.840 --> 01:58:58.923
I, Nicholas Wilde, promise to be brave...

1023
01:58:59.080 --> 01:59:02.004
loyal, helpful, and trustworthy.

1024
01:59:03.200 --> 01:59:05.980
Even though you're a fox?

1025
01:59:06.080 --> 01:59:07.411
What?

1026
01:59:09.920 --> 01:59:12.241
No! What did I do wrong, you guys?

1027
01:59:12.400 --> 01:59:14.607
No, please! Tell me! What did I do wrong?

1028
01:59:14.720 --> 01:59:16.370
What did I do?

1029
01:59:18.240 --> 01:59:20.766
If you thought we would ever
trust a fox without a muzzle...

1030
01:59:21.200 --> 01:59:23.851
you're even dumber than you look!

1031
01:59:25.200 --> 01:59:28.010
Aw, is he gonna cry?

1032
01:59:43.680 --> 01:59:46.160
I learned two things that day,

1033
01:59:46.320 --> 01:59:47.651
One...

1034
01:59:47.800 --> 01:59:51.850
I was never gonna let anyone see
that they got to me.

1035
01:59:52.640 --> 01:59:55.120
And two?

1036
01:59:55.240 --> 02:00:00.280
If the world's only gonna see a fox
as shifty and untrustworthy...

1037
02:00:00.440 --> 02:00:03.444
there's no point in trying
to be anything else.

1038
02:00:03.600 --> 02:00:07.161
Nick, you are so much more than that.

1039
02:00:11.320 --> 02:00:12.970
Boy, look at that traffic down there.

1040
02:00:13.120 --> 02:00:14.770
How about we go out to Chuck
in Traffic Central.

1041
02:00:14.960 --> 02:00:16.644
Chuck, how are things looking
on the Jam Cams?

1042
02:00:17.840 --> 02:00:19.968
Nick, I'm glad you told me.

1043
02:00:20.920 --> 02:00:22.410
The Jam Cams.

1044
02:00:22.560 --> 02:00:25.245
- Seriously. It's okay.
- No, no, no.

1045
02:00:25.400 --> 02:00:28.609
There are traffic cameras everywhere!

1046
02:00:28.760 --> 02:00:30.460
All over the canopy!

1047
02:00:30.560 --> 02:00:31.846
Whatever happened to that jaguar...

1048
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:33.206
The traffic cams would have caught it!

1049
02:00:33.400 --> 02:00:34.208
Bingo!

1050
02:00:34.760 --> 02:00:36.205
Pretty sneaky, slick!

1051
02:00:36.400 --> 02:00:39.722
However, if you didn't have access
to the system before...

1052
02:00:39.880 --> 02:00:43.521
I doubt Chief Buffalo Butt
is gonna let you into it now.

1053
02:00:43.680 --> 02:00:44.841
No.

1054
02:00:45.720 --> 02:00:48.007
But I have a friend
at City Hall who might.

1055
02:00:48.880 --> 02:00:51.611
Sir, if we could just review
these very important...

1056
02:00:52.240 --> 02:00:53.002
Sir...

1057
02:00:53.160 --> 02:00:54.525
I'm so sorry. Sir!

1058
02:00:54.640 --> 02:00:57.689
Okay. I heard you, Bellwether.
Just take care of it.

1059
02:00:58.360 --> 02:01:00.761
Please. And clear my afternoon.
I'm going out.

1060
02:01:00.920 --> 02:01:03.321
No, no! But, sir, you do have a meeting
with Herds and Grazing.

1061
02:01:03.480 --> 02:01:04.891
Sir, if I could just...

1062
02:01:06.600 --> 02:01:08.568
Oh, mutton chops.

1063
02:01:10.280 --> 02:01:11.770
Assistant Mayor Bellwether?

1064
02:01:11.920 --> 02:01:13.126
We need your help.

1065
02:01:14.640 --> 02:01:16.324
We just need to get into
the traffic cam database.

1066
02:01:25.440 --> 02:01:27.010
So fluffy!

1067
02:01:27.200 --> 02:01:27.928
Hey!

1068
02:01:28.120 --> 02:01:29.565
Sheep never let me get this close.

1069
02:01:29.720 --> 02:01:31.131
You can't just touch a sheep's wool!

1070
02:01:31.280 --> 02:01:32.281
It's like cotton candy.

1071
02:01:32.440 --> 02:01:33.407
Stop it!

1072
02:01:33.560 --> 02:01:34.641
Where to?

1073
02:01:35.120 --> 02:01:38.090
Rainforest District, Vine and Tujunga.

1074
02:01:38.360 --> 02:01:40.169
There! Traffic cams for the whole city.

1075
02:01:40.320 --> 02:01:42.527
This is so exciting, actually!

1076
02:01:42.680 --> 02:01:44.330
I never get to do anything this important.

1077
02:01:44.480 --> 02:01:46.881
But you're the Assistant Mayor
of Zootopia.

1078
02:01:47.040 --> 02:01:49.407
I'm more of a glorified secretary.

1079
02:01:49.600 --> 02:01:52.046
I think Mayor Lionheart
just wanted the sheep vote.

1080
02:01:52.200 --> 02:01:53.565
But he did give me that nice mug.

1081
02:01:55.760 --> 02:01:57.171
Feels good to be appreciated.

1082
02:01:57.320 --> 02:01:58.651
Smell-wether!

1083
02:01:58.800 --> 02:02:01.531
That's a fun little name he likes to use.

1084
02:02:01.680 --> 02:02:03.569
I called him Lion-fart once.

1085
02:02:03.720 --> 02:02:06.121
He did not care for that. Let me tell you,
it was not a good day for me.

1086
02:02:06.320 --> 02:02:07.048
Yes, sir?

1087
02:02:07.240 --> 02:02:08.844
I thought you were going to
cancel my afternoon!

1088
02:02:09.120 --> 02:02:10.884
Oh, dear. I better go.

1089
02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:14.641
Let me know what you find.
It was really nice for me to be...

1090
02:02:14.800 --> 02:02:16.723
While we're young, Smell-wether!

1091
02:02:19.080 --> 02:02:20.889
You think when she goes to sleep
she counts herself?

1092
02:02:21.040 --> 02:02:22.929
Shush. Okay, traffic cams.

1093
02:02:23.160 --> 02:02:26.209
Tujunga, Tujunga... We're in.

1094
02:02:31.800 --> 02:02:33.609
Who are these guys?

1095
02:02:34.760 --> 02:02:37.604
Timberwolves. Look at these dumb-dumbs.

1096
02:02:42.200 --> 02:02:44.851
Bet you a nickel
one of them is gonna howl.

1097
02:02:44.960 --> 02:02:46.325
And there it is.

1098
02:02:46.480 --> 02:02:49.220
What is it with wolves and the howling?
It's like...

1099
02:02:49.320 --> 02:02:51.243
Howlers. Night Howlers.

1100
02:02:51.400 --> 02:02:53.562
That's what Manchas was afraid of! Wolves!

1101
02:02:53.720 --> 02:02:56.200
The wolves are the Night Howlers.
If they took Manchas...

1102
02:02:56.360 --> 02:02:58.089
I'll bet they took Otterton, too.

1103
02:02:58.240 --> 02:03:00.766
All we gotta do
is find out where they went.

1104
02:03:08.320 --> 02:03:09.207
Wait, where did they go?

1105
02:03:09.360 --> 02:03:12.603
If I wanted to avoid surveillance
because I was doing something illegal...

1106
02:03:12.760 --> 02:03:13.727
which I never have...

1107
02:03:13.880 --> 02:03:15.689
I would use the maintenance tunnel 6B.

1108
02:03:16.360 --> 02:03:17.646
Which would put them out...

1109
02:03:17.760 --> 02:03:19.842
right there.

1110
02:03:19.960 --> 02:03:23.540
Well, look at you, Junior Detective.

1111
02:03:23.640 --> 02:03:27.850
You know, I think you'd actually
make a pretty good cop.

1112
02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:29.286
How dare you.

1113
02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:31.240
Acacia Alley?

1114
02:03:31.400 --> 02:03:32.731
Ficus Underpass.

1115
02:03:32.840 --> 02:03:34.100
South Canyon.

1116
02:03:34.200 --> 02:03:35.122
They're heading out of town.

1117
02:03:35.880 --> 02:03:37.484
Where does that road go?

1118
02:04:22.080 --> 02:04:23.241
Gary, quit it!

1119
02:04:23.360 --> 02:04:24.282
You're gonna start a howl.

1120
02:04:24.440 --> 02:04:25.441
I didn't start it!

1121
02:04:32.920 --> 02:04:34.365
Come on.

1122
02:04:42.160 --> 02:04:44.811
You are a clever bunny.

1123
02:05:00.560 --> 02:05:03.769
It looks like this was a hospital.

1124
02:05:16.800 --> 02:05:18.723
You know, after you. You're the cop.

1125
02:05:27.160 --> 02:05:29.367
Okay, all clear.

1126
02:05:34.320 --> 02:05:36.687
All this equipment is brand new.

1127
02:05:38.400 --> 02:05:39.401
Carrots.

1128
02:05:42.080 --> 02:05:43.127
Claw marks.

1129
02:05:43.240 --> 02:05:45.641
Yeah, huge claw marks. What kind of...

1130
02:06:05.240 --> 02:06:07.163
Mr. Manchas.

1131
02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:18.525
It's him.

1132
02:06:18.680 --> 02:06:20.682
We found our otter.

1133
02:06:20.840 --> 02:06:22.444
Mr. Otterton.

1134
02:06:22.640 --> 02:06:26.008
My name is Officer Judy Hopps.
Your wife sent me to find you.

1135
02:06:26.160 --> 02:06:27.969
We're gonna get you out of here now.

1136
02:06:29.240 --> 02:06:30.480
Or not.

1137
02:06:30.640 --> 02:06:32.927
Guess he's in no rush
to get home to the missus.

1138
02:06:33.080 --> 02:06:35.300
11, 12, 13, 14...

1139
02:06:35.400 --> 02:06:38.620
Not including Manchas, it's 14.

1140
02:06:38.720 --> 02:06:41.580
Chief Bogo
handed out 14 missing mammal files.

1141
02:06:41.680 --> 02:06:42.700
They're all here.

1142
02:06:42.800 --> 02:06:46.566
All the missing mammals are right here.

1143
02:06:51.760 --> 02:06:54.684
Enough! I don't want excuses, Doctor!

1144
02:06:54.800 --> 02:06:55.687
I want answers.

1145
02:06:55.840 --> 02:06:57.126
Mayor Lionheart, please.

1146
02:06:57.240 --> 02:06:59.140
We're doing everything we can.

1147
02:06:59.240 --> 02:07:00.140
Really?

1148
02:07:00.240 --> 02:07:02.140
Because I got a dozen and a half
animals here

1149
02:07:02.240 --> 02:07:03.969
who have gone off-the-rails crazy...

1150
02:07:04.160 --> 02:07:05.685
and you can't tell me why.

1151
02:07:05.800 --> 02:07:08.451
Now, I'd call that awfully far
from "doing everything."

1152
02:07:08.600 --> 02:07:09.806
Sir...

1153
02:07:09.960 --> 02:07:11.689
it may be time to consider their biology.

1154
02:07:11.880 --> 02:07:13.723
What? What do you mean "biology?"

1155
02:07:13.880 --> 02:07:16.770
The only animals going savage
are predators.

1156
02:07:16.880 --> 02:07:19.531
We cannot keep it a secret.
We need to come forward.

1157
02:07:20.840 --> 02:07:22.524
Great idea. Tell the public.

1158
02:07:22.720 --> 02:07:25.690
And how do you think they're gonna feel
about their mayor...

1159
02:07:25.840 --> 02:07:27.500
who is a lion?

1160
02:07:27.600 --> 02:07:28.740
I'll be ruined!

1161
02:07:28.840 --> 02:07:30.126
Well, what does Chief Bogo say?

1162
02:07:30.280 --> 02:07:32.442
Chief Bogo doesn't know.

1163
02:07:32.600 --> 02:07:35.843
And we are going to keep it that way.

1164
02:07:36.640 --> 02:07:37.482
No, no, no!

1165
02:07:37.680 --> 02:07:38.920
Someone's here.

1166
02:07:39.080 --> 02:07:40.525
Sir, you need to go, now!

1167
02:07:40.680 --> 02:07:42.364
Security! Sweep the area!

1168
02:07:50.480 --> 02:07:52.289
Great! We're dead. We're dead.

1169
02:07:52.400 --> 02:07:54.721
That's it. I'm dead, you're dead.
Everybody's dead!

1170
02:07:54.880 --> 02:07:55.961
Can you swim?

1171
02:07:56.120 --> 02:07:58.964
What? Can I swim? Yes, I can swim. Why?

1172
02:08:18.920 --> 02:08:22.811
Carrots! Hopps! Judy!

1173
02:08:23.520 --> 02:08:25.249
We gotta tell Bogo!

1174
02:08:26.400 --> 02:08:30.803
Wow! You are one hot dancer, Chief Bogo.

1175
02:08:33.360 --> 02:08:35.140
- Chief Bogo!
- Not now!

1176
02:08:35.240 --> 02:08:36.241
Wait, is that Gazelle?

1177
02:08:36.360 --> 02:08:37.168
No.

1178
02:08:37.320 --> 02:08:40.164
I'm Gazelle, and you are one hot dancer.

1179
02:08:40.280 --> 02:08:42.009
You have the app too?

1180
02:08:43.400 --> 02:08:44.526
Chief!

1181
02:08:44.720 --> 02:08:47.371
Clawhauser, can't you see I'm working
on the missing mammal cases?

1182
02:08:47.560 --> 02:08:49.722
Yes of course! About that, sir.
Officer Hopps just called.

1183
02:08:51.280 --> 02:08:52.327
She found all of them.

1184
02:08:53.120 --> 02:08:55.168
Wow! I'm impressed.

1185
02:08:58.360 --> 02:09:01.011
Mayor Lionheart, you have the right
to remain silent. Anything...

1186
02:09:01.160 --> 02:09:03.845
You don't understand.
I was trying to protect the city!

1187
02:09:03.960 --> 02:09:06.042
You were just trying to protect your job.

1188
02:09:06.240 --> 02:09:09.084
No. Listen, we still don't know
why this is happening.

1189
02:09:09.240 --> 02:09:11.500
It could destroy Zootopia.

1190
02:09:11.600 --> 02:09:12.761
You have the right to remain silent.

1191
02:09:12.960 --> 02:09:15.406
Anything you say can and will
be used against you in a court of law.

1192
02:09:20.920 --> 02:09:22.160
Ladies and gentlemammals.

1193
02:09:23.280 --> 02:09:25.123
14 mammals went missing...

1194
02:09:25.360 --> 02:09:28.967
and all 14 have been found
by our newest recruit...

1195
02:09:29.120 --> 02:09:30.406
who will speak to you in a moment.

1196
02:09:30.600 --> 02:09:31.860
But first, let me remind you...

1197
02:09:31.960 --> 02:09:33.041
I'm so nervous.

1198
02:09:33.200 --> 02:09:35.009
Okay. Press Conference 101.

1199
02:09:35.160 --> 02:09:37.731
You wanna look smart? Answer
their question with your own question...

1200
02:09:37.880 --> 02:09:40.929
and then answer that question. Like this.

1201
02:09:41.080 --> 02:09:44.448
"Excuse me. Officer Hopps,
what can you tell us about the case?"

1202
02:09:44.600 --> 02:09:46.204
"Well, was this a tough case?

1203
02:09:46.360 --> 02:09:48.488
"Yes. Yes, it was." You see?

1204
02:09:48.640 --> 02:09:50.324
You should be there with me.

1205
02:09:50.480 --> 02:09:51.925
We did this together.

1206
02:09:52.080 --> 02:09:55.163
Well, am I a cop? No. No, I am not.

1207
02:09:55.720 --> 02:09:59.884
Funny you should say that,
because I've been thinking...

1208
02:10:00.080 --> 02:10:04.563
It would be nice to have a partner.

1209
02:10:09.120 --> 02:10:12.886
Here. In case
you need something to write with.

1210
02:10:14.680 --> 02:10:17.650
At twenty-two hundred hours,
we found all these missing animals...

1211
02:10:17.800 --> 02:10:20.406
Officer Hopps, it's time.

1212
02:10:20.560 --> 02:10:24.220
They appear to be in good health,
physically if not emotionally

1213
02:10:24.320 --> 02:10:29.281
So now, I'll turn things over
to the officer who cracked the case.

1214
02:10:29.560 --> 02:10:31.164
Officer Judy Hopps.

1215
02:10:32.800 --> 02:10:34.768
- Officer Hopps!
- Officer Hopps!

1216
02:10:34.880 --> 02:10:35.802
Over here!

1217
02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:36.808
Yes?

1218
02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:38.764
What can you tell us about
the animals that went savage?

1219
02:10:38.960 --> 02:10:43.443
Well, the animals in question...

1220
02:10:46.400 --> 02:10:48.562
Are they all different species?

1221
02:10:48.760 --> 02:10:50.762
Yes. Yes, they are.

1222
02:10:51.880 --> 02:10:54.180
Okay, so what is the connection?

1223
02:10:54.280 --> 02:10:58.060
All we know is that they are all
members of the predator family.

1224
02:10:58.160 --> 02:11:01.289
So, predators
are the only ones going savage?

1225
02:11:01.400 --> 02:11:04.131
That is accurate. Yes.

1226
02:11:04.280 --> 02:11:05.645
Why is this happening?

1227
02:11:05.760 --> 02:11:06.886
We still don't know.

1228
02:11:09.720 --> 02:11:13.460
It may have something to do with biology.

1229
02:11:13.560 --> 02:11:14.925
What do you mean by that?

1230
02:11:15.040 --> 02:11:17.300
A biological component.

1231
02:11:17.400 --> 02:11:20.609
You know, something in their DNA.

1232
02:11:21.280 --> 02:11:23.260
In their DNA?
Can you elaborate on that, please?

1233
02:11:23.360 --> 02:11:27.649
Yes, what I mean is,
thousands of years ago...

1234
02:11:29.320 --> 02:11:34.100
predators survived through
their aggressive...

1235
02:11:34.200 --> 02:11:35.884
hunting instincts.

1236
02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:37.001
For whatever reason...

1237
02:11:37.120 --> 02:11:39.600
they seem to be reverting back
to their primitive, savage ways.

1238
02:11:39.920 --> 02:11:41.410
Of course they did.

1239
02:11:44.160 --> 02:11:45.580
Aw, is he gonna cry?

1240
02:11:45.680 --> 02:11:47.780
Officer Hopps, could it happen again?

1241
02:11:47.880 --> 02:11:51.260
It is possible. So we must be vigilant.

1242
02:11:51.360 --> 02:11:54.660
And we at the ZPD are prepared
and are here to protect you.

1243
02:11:54.760 --> 02:11:56.260
Will more mammals go savage?

1244
02:11:56.360 --> 02:11:57.566
What is being done to protect us?

1245
02:11:57.680 --> 02:12:00.100
Have you considered a mandatory
quarantine on predators?

1246
02:12:00.200 --> 02:12:03.420
Okay, thank you, Officer Hopps.
That's all the time that we have.

1247
02:12:03.520 --> 02:12:04.851
No more questions.

1248
02:12:07.360 --> 02:12:08.407
Was I okay?

1249
02:12:08.560 --> 02:12:10.881
You did fine.

1250
02:12:11.040 --> 02:12:12.620
That went so fast.

1251
02:12:12.720 --> 02:12:15.260
I didn't get a chance to mention you,
or say anything about how we...

1252
02:12:15.360 --> 02:12:17.940
I think you said plenty.

1253
02:12:18.040 --> 02:12:19.769
What do you mean?

1254
02:12:19.880 --> 02:12:22.247
"Clearly there's a biological component?"

1255
02:12:22.440 --> 02:12:27.287
"These predators may be reverting back
to their primitive, savage ways?"

1256
02:12:27.440 --> 02:12:29.044
Are you serious?

1257
02:12:29.280 --> 02:12:31.726
I just stated the facts of the case.

1258
02:12:31.880 --> 02:12:34.406
I mean it's not like
a bunny could go savage.

1259
02:12:34.520 --> 02:12:36.409
Right. But a fox could?

1260
02:12:36.560 --> 02:12:38.881
Nick, stop it. You're not like them.

1261
02:12:39.080 --> 02:12:40.809
Oh, there's a "them" now?

1262
02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:43.651
You know what I mean.
You're not that kind of predator.

1263
02:12:43.800 --> 02:12:45.290
The kind that needs to be muzzled?

1264
02:12:45.440 --> 02:12:49.445
The kind that makes you think
you need to carry around fox repellent?

1265
02:12:49.600 --> 02:12:53.446
Yeah, don't think I didn't notice
that little item the first time we met.

1266
02:12:53.600 --> 02:12:56.763
So let me ask you a question.
Are you afraid of me?

1267
02:12:58.320 --> 02:13:00.766
Do you think I might go nuts?

1268
02:13:01.240 --> 02:13:03.083
Do you think I might go savage?

1269
02:13:03.240 --> 02:13:05.322
Do you think I might try to...

1270
02:13:05.520 --> 02:13:06.521
eat you?

1271
02:13:10.120 --> 02:13:11.690
I knew it.

1272
02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.287
Just when I thought somebody
actually believed in me.

1273
02:13:16.440 --> 02:13:20.206
Probably best if you don't have
a predator as a partner.

1274
02:13:26.040 --> 02:13:28.122
No. Nick. Nick!

1275
02:13:28.280 --> 02:13:30.282
Officer Hopps! Were you just
threatened by that predator?

1276
02:13:30.440 --> 02:13:32.124
No, he's my friend.

1277
02:13:32.240 --> 02:13:34.083
We can't even trust our own friends?

1278
02:13:34.280 --> 02:13:36.123
That is not what I said! Please!

1279
02:13:36.280 --> 02:13:36.963
Are we safe?

1280
02:13:37.120 --> 02:13:38.963
Have any foxes gone savage?

1281
02:13:39.360 --> 02:13:41.660
More bad news in this city
gripped by fear.

1282
02:13:41.760 --> 02:13:44.889
A caribou is in critical condition,
the victim of a mauling...

1283
02:13:45.040 --> 02:13:47.042
by a savage polar bear.

1284
02:13:47.160 --> 02:13:49.540
This, the 27th such attack,
comes just one week...

1285
02:13:49.640 --> 02:13:53.060
after ZPD Officer Judy Hopps
connected the violence

1286
02:13:53.160 --> 02:13:55.845
to traditionally predatory animals.

1287
02:13:56.040 --> 02:13:59.726
Meanwhile, a peace rally
organized by pop star Gazelle...

1288
02:13:59.840 --> 02:14:01.300
was marred by protest.

1289
02:14:01.400 --> 02:14:02.845
Go back to the forest, predator!

1290
02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:04.980
I'm from the savanna!

1291
02:14:05.080 --> 02:14:06.969
Zootopia is a unique place.

1292
02:14:07.120 --> 02:14:10.567
It's a crazy, beautiful, diverse city...

1293
02:14:10.720 --> 02:14:13.121
where we celebrate our differences.

1294
02:14:13.280 --> 02:14:14.725
This is not the Zootopia I know

1295
02:14:16.240 --> 02:14:19.323
The Zootopia I know is better than this.

1296
02:14:19.480 --> 02:14:21.721
We don't just blindly assign blame.

1297
02:14:26.880 --> 02:14:29.167
We don't know why these attacks
keep happening...

1298
02:14:30.040 --> 02:14:34.170
but it is irresponsible
to label all predators as savages.

1299
02:14:40.600 --> 02:14:42.682
That's not my Emmitt.

1300
02:14:45.160 --> 02:14:47.606
We cannot let fear divide us.

1301
02:14:47.760 --> 02:14:52.322
Please give me back the Zootopia I love.

1302
02:14:55.480 --> 02:14:56.891
Come on, Hopps.

1303
02:14:57.040 --> 02:14:58.405
The new mayor wants to see us.

1304
02:14:58.560 --> 02:15:00.881
The mayor? Why?

1305
02:15:01.040 --> 02:15:04.010
It would seem you've arrived.

1306
02:15:07.200 --> 02:15:08.884
Clawhauser?

1307
02:15:09.040 --> 02:15:10.610
What are you doing?

1308
02:15:12.400 --> 02:15:14.289
They thought it would be better...

1309
02:15:14.440 --> 02:15:19.207
if a predator such as myself
wasn't the first face that you see...

1310
02:15:19.360 --> 02:15:21.522
when you walk into the ZPD.

1311
02:15:21.800 --> 02:15:22.926
What?

1312
02:15:23.960 --> 02:15:26.440
They're gonna move me to records.
It's downstairs.

1313
02:15:27.120 --> 02:15:29.088
It's by the boiler.

1314
02:15:31.200 --> 02:15:32.690
Hopps!

1315
02:15:39.600 --> 02:15:41.090
I don't understand.

1316
02:15:41.240 --> 02:15:44.244
Our city is 90% prey, Judy...

1317
02:15:44.400 --> 02:15:46.926
and right now they're just really scared.

1318
02:15:47.640 --> 02:15:50.610
You're a hero to them. They trust you.

1319
02:15:50.760 --> 02:15:57.086
And so that's why Chief Bogo and I want
you to be the public face of the ZPD.

1320
02:16:05.600 --> 02:16:07.284
I'm not a hero.

1321
02:16:08.040 --> 02:16:11.487
I came here
to make the world a better place...

1322
02:16:11.640 --> 02:16:13.210
but I think I broke it.

1323
02:16:13.360 --> 02:16:17.524
Don't give yourself so much credit, Hopps.

1324
02:16:17.680 --> 02:16:21.127
The world has always been broken,
that's why we need good cops.

1325
02:16:22.640 --> 02:16:23.801
Like you.

1326
02:16:25.360 --> 02:16:30.321
With all due respect, sir, a good cop...

1327
02:16:30.560 --> 02:16:33.803
is supposed to serve and protect.

1328
02:16:33.960 --> 02:16:36.247
Help the city.

1329
02:16:36.520 --> 02:16:38.887
Not tear it apart.

1330
02:16:42.360 --> 02:16:44.840
I don't deserve this badge.

1331
02:16:44.960 --> 02:16:45.802
Hopps...

1332
02:16:45.920 --> 02:16:49.140
Judy, you've worked so hard to get here.

1333
02:16:49.240 --> 02:16:51.846
It's what you wanted since you were a kid.

1334
02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:53.684
You can't quit.

1335
02:16:53.840 --> 02:16:55.888
Thank you for the opportunity.

1336
02:17:15.320 --> 02:17:16.810
A dozen carrots.

1337
02:17:16.960 --> 02:17:18.086
- Thanks.
- Have a nice day.

1338
02:17:18.240 --> 02:17:19.287
Come on.

1339
02:17:25.720 --> 02:17:27.927
Hey, there, Jude. Jude the dude.

1340
02:17:28.120 --> 02:17:30.851
Remember that one? How we doing?

1341
02:17:31.040 --> 02:17:32.041
I'm fine.

1342
02:17:32.200 --> 02:17:34.646
You are not fine. Your ears are droopy.

1343
02:17:35.960 --> 02:17:38.327
Why did I think I could make a difference?

1344
02:17:38.440 --> 02:17:40.090
Because you're a trier, that's why.

1345
02:17:40.240 --> 02:17:41.890
You've always been a trier.

1346
02:17:42.040 --> 02:17:43.485
Oh, I tried.

1347
02:17:43.600 --> 02:17:47.446
And it made life so much
worse for so many innocent predators.

1348
02:17:48.200 --> 02:17:49.850
Not all of them, though.
Speak of the devil.

1349
02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:51.240
Right on time.

1350
02:17:53.280 --> 02:17:56.090
Is that Gideon Grey?

1351
02:17:56.240 --> 02:17:58.242
Yep. It sure is. We work with him now.

1352
02:17:58.440 --> 02:17:59.487
He's our partner.

1353
02:17:59.640 --> 02:18:01.642
And we would never have considered it
had you not opened our minds.

1354
02:18:01.800 --> 02:18:02.801
That's right.

1355
02:18:02.960 --> 02:18:05.531
Gid's turned into one of the
top pastry chefs in the tri-burrows.

1356
02:18:09.920 --> 02:18:12.651
That's really cool, you guys.

1357
02:18:13.160 --> 02:18:14.491
Gideon Grey.

1358
02:18:14.960 --> 02:18:16.086
I'll be darned.

1359
02:18:16.240 --> 02:18:20.689
Hey, Judy. I'd just like to say I'm sorry
for the way I behaved in my youth.

1360
02:18:20.880 --> 02:18:22.644
I had a lot of self-doubt,

1361
02:18:22.760 --> 02:18:26.367
and it manifested itself in the form
of unchecked rage and aggression.

1362
02:18:26.520 --> 02:18:28.682
I was a major jerk.

1363
02:18:29.720 --> 02:18:33.247
I know a thing or two about being a jerk.

1364
02:18:34.320 --> 02:18:37.005
Anyhow, I brought y'all these pies.

1365
02:18:38.400 --> 02:18:41.847
Hey, kids, don't you run through
that midnicampum holicithias.

1366
02:18:42.800 --> 02:18:44.643
Well, now, there's a $4 word, Mr. H.

1367
02:18:44.800 --> 02:18:47.451
My family always
just called them Night Howlers.

1368
02:18:49.080 --> 02:18:50.411
What did you say?

1369
02:18:50.560 --> 02:18:51.288
Gid's talking about those flowers, Judy.

1370
02:18:52.440 --> 02:18:54.090
I use them to keep the bugs
off the produce...

1371
02:18:54.240 --> 02:18:55.810
but I don't like the little ones
going near 'em...

1372
02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:57.365
on account of what happened
to your uncle Terry.

1373
02:18:57.520 --> 02:18:59.340
Yeah, Terry ate one whole
when we were kids

1374
02:18:59.440 --> 02:19:00.680
and went completely nuts.

1375
02:19:00.880 --> 02:19:03.167
He bit the dickens out of your mother.

1376
02:19:03.320 --> 02:19:05.641
A bunny can go savage.

1377
02:19:05.840 --> 02:19:09.128
Savage? Well, that's a strong word.
But it did hurt like the devil.

1378
02:19:09.280 --> 02:19:13.330
Sure it did! There's a sizable divot
in your arm. I'd call that savage.

1379
02:19:13.480 --> 02:19:16.848
Night Howlers aren't wolves,
they're flowers!

1380
02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:20.049
The flowers are making
the predators go savage!

1381
02:19:20.200 --> 02:19:22.202
That's it! That's what I've been missing!

1382
02:19:22.840 --> 02:19:23.887
Keys!

1383
02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:25.286
Keys, keys, keys! Hurry! Come on!

1384
02:19:26.240 --> 02:19:27.969
Thank you! I love you! Bye!

1385
02:19:33.480 --> 02:19:34.561
You catch any of that, Bon?

1386
02:19:34.720 --> 02:19:35.767
Not one bit.

1387
02:19:35.920 --> 02:19:39.606
That makes me feel a little bit better.
I thought she was talking in tongues.

1388
02:19:56.920 --> 02:19:58.729
Who is it?

1389
02:19:59.000 --> 02:19:59.922
I need to find Nick.

1390
02:20:00.080 --> 02:20:01.525
Please.

1391
02:20:02.720 --> 02:20:03.767
Nick?

1392
02:20:04.520 --> 02:20:05.851
Nick!

1393
02:20:08.560 --> 02:20:10.210
Oh, Nick.

1394
02:20:10.320 --> 02:20:12.084
Night Howlers aren't wolves.

1395
02:20:12.280 --> 02:20:13.964
They're toxic flowers.

1396
02:20:14.600 --> 02:20:16.180
I think someone
is targeting predators on purpose

1397
02:20:16.280 --> 02:20:18.760
and making them go savage!

1398
02:20:19.160 --> 02:20:20.446
Wow.

1399
02:20:21.680 --> 02:20:23.569
Isn't that interesting?

1400
02:20:26.080 --> 02:20:29.971
Wait! I know you'll never forgive me!
And I don't blame you.

1401
02:20:30.880 --> 02:20:33.884
I wouldn't forgive me either.
I was ignorant...

1402
02:20:34.880 --> 02:20:38.566
And irresponsible and small-minded.

1403
02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.571
But predators shouldn't have
to suffer for my mistakes.

1404
02:20:43.480 --> 02:20:45.482
I have to fix this.

1405
02:20:45.920 --> 02:20:48.321
But I can't do it without you.

1406
02:20:50.680 --> 02:20:53.365
And after we're done...

1407
02:20:53.520 --> 02:20:55.249
you can hate me.

1408
02:20:56.280 --> 02:20:57.884
And that'll be fine.

1409
02:20:58.080 --> 02:21:01.368
Because I was a horrible friend...

1410
02:21:01.520 --> 02:21:02.931
and I hurt you.

1411
02:21:03.080 --> 02:21:09.565
And you can walk away knowing
that you were right all along.

1412
02:21:09.760 --> 02:21:13.731
I really am just a dumb bunny.

1413
02:21:17.680 --> 02:21:21.287
I really am just a dumb bunny,

1414
02:21:22.960 --> 02:21:26.248
I really am just a dumb bunny,

1415
02:21:26.440 --> 02:21:29.364
Don't worry, Carrots.
I'll let you erase it...

1416
02:21:29.520 --> 02:21:30.521
in 48 hours.

1417
02:21:33.440 --> 02:21:35.920
All right. Get in here.

1418
02:21:37.760 --> 02:21:41.845
Okay. You bunnies are so emotional.

1419
02:21:42.160 --> 02:21:44.447
There we go. Deep breath.

1420
02:21:44.600 --> 02:21:48.286
Are you just trying to steal the pen?
Is that what this is?

1421
02:21:49.280 --> 02:21:51.260
You are standing on my tail, though.
Off, off, off.

1422
02:21:51.360 --> 02:21:52.202
I'm sorry.

1423
02:21:57.280 --> 02:21:59.806
I thought you guys only grew carrots.

1424
02:22:00.680 --> 02:22:01.681
What's the plan?

1425
02:22:01.920 --> 02:22:03.570
We are gonna follow the Night Howlers.

1426
02:22:03.720 --> 02:22:04.926
Okay. How?

1427
02:22:05.120 --> 02:22:06.451
Know this guy?

1428
02:22:07.280 --> 02:22:09.044
I told you. I know everybody.

1429
02:22:10.480 --> 02:22:13.529
Step right up.
Anything you need, I got it.

1430
02:22:13.800 --> 02:22:14.722
All your favorite movies!

1431
02:22:14.840 --> 02:22:17.002
I got movies that
haven't even been released yet.

1432
02:22:18.480 --> 02:22:21.529
Hey, 15% off! 20!
Make me an offer! Come on!

1433
02:22:21.680 --> 02:22:25.480
Well, well, look who it is.
The duke of bootleg.

1434
02:22:25.720 --> 02:22:26.687
What's it to you, Wilde?

1435
02:22:26.800 --> 02:22:28.211
Shouldn't you be melting down
a popsicle or something?

1436
02:22:28.360 --> 02:22:29.441
Hey, if it ain't Flopsy the Copsy.

1437
02:22:30.840 --> 02:22:34.083
We both know those weren't
moldy onions I caught you stealing.

1438
02:22:34.240 --> 02:22:36.481
What were you gonna do
with those Night Howlers, Wezzleton?

1439
02:22:36.680 --> 02:22:38.569
It's Weaselton! Duke Weaselton!

1440
02:22:38.760 --> 02:22:40.603
And I ain't talking, rabbit.

1441
02:22:40.760 --> 02:22:42.888
And there ain't nothing
you can do to make me.

1442
02:22:44.440 --> 02:22:45.487
Ice him.

1443
02:22:48.680 --> 02:22:51.206
You dirty rat! Why are you helping her?
She's a cop!

1444
02:22:51.400 --> 02:22:54.404
And the godmother
to my future granddaughter.

1445
02:22:54.560 --> 02:22:56.688
I'm gonna name her Judy.

1446
02:22:58.840 --> 02:23:00.001
Ice this weasel.

1447
02:23:00.200 --> 02:23:02.328
All right, all right, please!
I'll talk! I'll talk.

1448
02:23:02.480 --> 02:23:03.970
I stole them Night Howlers
so I could sell 'em.

1449
02:23:04.080 --> 02:23:06.003
They offered me what I couldn't refuse.

1450
02:23:06.160 --> 02:23:06.968
Money.

1451
02:23:07.200 --> 02:23:09.043
And to whom did you sell them?

1452
02:23:09.200 --> 02:23:12.204
A ram named Doug.
We got a drop spot underground.

1453
02:23:12.360 --> 02:23:15.364
Just watch it.
Doug is the opposite of friendly,

1454
02:23:16.360 --> 02:23:17.885
He's unfriendly,

1455
02:23:28.040 --> 02:23:29.280
Come on.

1456
02:23:42.280 --> 02:23:44.089
The weasel wasn't lying.

1457
02:23:44.240 --> 02:23:47.244
Yeah, looks like old Doug's cornered
the market on Night Howlers.

1458
02:24:31.160 --> 02:24:32.082
You got Doug here.

1459
02:24:32.920 --> 02:24:34.968
What's the mark?

1460
02:24:35.120 --> 02:24:39.284
Cheetah in Sahara Square. Got it.

1461
02:24:39.440 --> 02:24:41.124
Serious? Yeah, I know they're fast.

1462
02:24:41.280 --> 02:24:42.361
I can hit him.

1463
02:24:42.560 --> 02:24:45.530
Listen, I hit a tiny little otter through
the open window of a moving car.

1464
02:25:00.560 --> 02:25:02.608
Yeah, I'll buzz you when it's done.

1465
02:25:02.760 --> 02:25:05.161
Or you'll see it on the news.
You know, whichever comes first.

1466
02:25:06.160 --> 02:25:09.323
Hey, Doug, open up! We've got your latte.

1467
02:25:09.440 --> 02:25:12.330
Woolter and Jesse are back,
so I'm leaving now.

1468
02:25:12.520 --> 02:25:13.540
Out.

1469
02:25:13.640 --> 02:25:14.900
Where are you going? Get back here!

1470
02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:17.241
What are you doing? He's gonna see you!

1471
02:25:17.360 --> 02:25:18.885
What are you looking at? Hey!

1472
02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:21.571
Whatever you're thinking,
stop thinking it. Carrots!

1473
02:25:22.600 --> 02:25:23.601
Carrots!

1474
02:25:23.800 --> 02:25:26.087
It better have the extra foam this time.

1475
02:25:29.240 --> 02:25:30.241
Hey, open up!

1476
02:25:30.400 --> 02:25:32.846
What are you doing?
You just trapped us in here.

1477
02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:34.604
We need to get this evidence to the ZPD!

1478
02:25:34.840 --> 02:25:36.763
Great! Here it is. Got it!

1479
02:25:36.920 --> 02:25:38.843
- No. All of it!
- Wait, what?

1480
02:25:42.880 --> 02:25:45.360
Great, you're a conductor now?

1481
02:25:45.520 --> 02:25:48.126
It would take a miracle
to get this rust-bucket going.

1482
02:25:50.080 --> 02:25:52.048
Well. Hallelujah.

1483
02:25:52.200 --> 02:25:54.980
We kinda got a situation at the lab.

1484
02:25:55.080 --> 02:25:56.206
It just got worse!

1485
02:25:58.080 --> 02:25:59.180
Mission accomplished.

1486
02:25:59.280 --> 02:26:01.681
Would it be premature
for me to do a little victory toot-toot?

1487
02:26:01.880 --> 02:26:04.360
All right. One toot-toot.

1488
02:26:06.840 --> 02:26:09.286
Well, I can cross that
off the bucket list.

1489
02:26:20.080 --> 02:26:22.731
I may have to rescind that victory
toot-toot.

1490
02:26:24.480 --> 02:26:25.845
Maybe that's just hail.

1491
02:26:26.680 --> 02:26:27.522
Come here!

1492
02:26:29.880 --> 02:26:31.609
Back off!

1493
02:26:36.120 --> 02:26:37.565
Incoming!

1494
02:26:40.120 --> 02:26:40.769
Carrots!

1495
02:26:40.960 --> 02:26:42.405
Don't stop! Keep going!

1496
02:26:42.560 --> 02:26:43.925
No, no! Please stop!

1497
02:26:44.120 --> 02:26:45.770
Do not stop this car!

1498
02:27:07.840 --> 02:27:09.569
Speed up, Nick! Speed up!

1499
02:27:09.760 --> 02:27:11.046
There's another train coming!

1500
02:27:11.240 --> 02:27:12.685
Trust me. Speed up!

1501
02:27:16.960 --> 02:27:18.724
Stop the train!

1502
02:27:19.680 --> 02:27:20.681
Hey!

1503
02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:22.650
Need some help?

1504
02:27:26.320 --> 02:27:27.651
Oh, no, no, no! Too fast!

1505
02:27:27.840 --> 02:27:29.604
Hold on!

1506
02:27:41.080 --> 02:27:42.730
I think this is our stop!

1507
02:27:51.800 --> 02:27:54.280
Maybe some of the evidence survived.

1508
02:28:03.840 --> 02:28:05.410
Everything is gone.

1509
02:28:05.560 --> 02:28:07.847
We've lost it all.

1510
02:28:07.960 --> 02:28:09.007
Yeah...

1511
02:28:09.120 --> 02:28:10.485
except for this.

1512
02:28:12.240 --> 02:28:13.780
Nick! Yes!

1513
02:28:13.880 --> 02:28:16.087
Come on! We gotta get to the ZPD.

1514
02:28:16.720 --> 02:28:18.927
Cut through the Natural History Museum!

1515
02:28:30.680 --> 02:28:31.647
There it is!

1516
02:28:31.800 --> 02:28:35.009
Judy!

1517
02:28:35.200 --> 02:28:37.043
Mayor Bellwether!

1518
02:28:37.200 --> 02:28:38.281
We found out what's happening.

1519
02:28:38.440 --> 02:28:40.283
Someone's darting predators with a serum.

1520
02:28:40.440 --> 02:28:42.363
That's what's making them go savage.

1521
02:28:42.520 --> 02:28:45.364
I'm so proud of you, Judy.
You did just a super job!

1522
02:28:45.520 --> 02:28:47.204
Thank you, ma'am.

1523
02:28:51.320 --> 02:28:53.163
How did you know where to find us?

1524
02:28:53.320 --> 02:28:55.163
I'll go ahead and I'll take that case now.

1525
02:28:55.320 --> 02:29:00.326
You know what? I think Nick and I
will just take this to the ZPD.

1526
02:29:04.880 --> 02:29:05.881
Run.

1527
02:29:07.080 --> 02:29:08.491
Get them.

1528
02:29:14.480 --> 02:29:15.163
Carrots!

1529
02:29:17.240 --> 02:29:19.242
I got you! Come here, come here.

1530
02:29:21.480 --> 02:29:23.562
Okay, now just relax.

1531
02:29:24.920 --> 02:29:25.921
Blueberry?

1532
02:29:26.080 --> 02:29:27.161
Pass.

1533
02:29:28.920 --> 02:29:30.922
Come on out, Judy.

1534
02:29:31.120 --> 02:29:32.360
Take the case.

1535
02:29:32.560 --> 02:29:33.766
Get it to Bogo.

1536
02:29:33.920 --> 02:29:35.524
I'm not gonna leave you behind.
That's not happening.

1537
02:29:35.720 --> 02:29:37.085
I can't walk.

1538
02:29:37.240 --> 02:29:38.241
We'll think of something.

1539
02:29:38.400 --> 02:29:40.767
We're on the same team, Judy.

1540
02:29:40.920 --> 02:29:44.811
Underestimated, underappreciated.

1541
02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:47.082
Aren't you sick of it?

1542
02:29:49.920 --> 02:29:53.720
Predators. They may be strong and loud...

1543
02:29:53.880 --> 02:29:57.487
but prey outnumber predators 10 to 1.

1544
02:30:01.080 --> 02:30:02.127
Think of it.

1545
02:30:02.320 --> 02:30:04.288
90% of the population...

1546
02:30:04.440 --> 02:30:06.681
united against a common enemy.

1547
02:30:06.800 --> 02:30:09.280
We'll be unstoppable.

1548
02:30:15.360 --> 02:30:16.805
Over there!

1549
02:30:20.720 --> 02:30:21.721
Help!

1550
02:30:33.480 --> 02:30:36.245
Well, you should have just stayed
on the carrot farm, huh?

1551
02:30:36.400 --> 02:30:38.926
It really is too bad. I did like you.

1552
02:30:39.120 --> 02:30:41.646
What are you going to do? Kill me?

1553
02:30:42.720 --> 02:30:44.643
No, of course not.

1554
02:30:44.800 --> 02:30:45.801
He is.

1555
02:30:46.640 --> 02:30:49.120
No! Nick!

1556
02:30:49.880 --> 02:30:54.249
Yes, police! There's a savage fox
in the Natural History Museum.

1557
02:30:54.400 --> 02:30:56.482
Officer Hopps is down! Please, hurry.

1558
02:30:56.600 --> 02:30:59.001
No. Nick, don't do this. Fight it.

1559
02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:02.241
But he can't help it, can he?

1560
02:31:02.440 --> 02:31:06.923
Since preds are just biologically
predisposed to be savages.

1561
02:31:18.320 --> 02:31:20.687
Gosh. Think of the headline!

1562
02:31:20.840 --> 02:31:25.050
"Hero cop killed by savage fox."

1563
02:31:26.200 --> 02:31:29.841
So that's it? Prey fears predator,
and you stay in power?

1564
02:31:30.040 --> 02:31:31.530
Yeah, pretty much.

1565
02:31:31.680 --> 02:31:32.727
It won't work!

1566
02:31:32.920 --> 02:31:35.491
Fear always works.

1567
02:31:35.640 --> 02:31:38.723
And I'll dart every predator
in Zootopia to keep it that way.

1568
02:31:41.840 --> 02:31:42.966
Oh, Nick.

1569
02:31:43.560 --> 02:31:44.686
No.

1570
02:31:47.240 --> 02:31:48.571
Bye-bye, bunny.

1571
02:31:55.160 --> 02:31:59.404
Blood! Blood! Blood and death.

1572
02:31:59.560 --> 02:32:00.800
All right, you're milking it.

1573
02:32:01.040 --> 02:32:02.246
Besides, I think we got it.

1574
02:32:02.400 --> 02:32:04.620
We got it up there, thank you, Yakety-yak!

1575
02:32:04.720 --> 02:32:06.609
You laid it all out beautifully.

1576
02:32:06.720 --> 02:32:07.562
What?

1577
02:32:07.720 --> 02:32:08.881
Are you looking for the serum?

1578
02:32:09.600 --> 02:32:10.681
Well, it's right here.

1579
02:32:10.840 --> 02:32:11.887
What you've got in the weapon there?

1580
02:32:12.040 --> 02:32:15.123
Those are blueberries.
From my family's farm.

1581
02:32:15.240 --> 02:32:17.641
They are delicious. You should try some.

1582
02:32:18.800 --> 02:32:21.371
I framed Lionheart. I can frame you, too.

1583
02:32:21.520 --> 02:32:23.761
It's my word against yours.

1584
02:32:24.760 --> 02:32:26.091
Actually...

1585
02:32:26.240 --> 02:32:29.926
And I'll dart every predator in Zootopia
to keep it that way,

1586
02:32:30.080 --> 02:32:31.844
it's your word against yours.

1587
02:32:31.960 --> 02:32:35.089
It's called a hustle, sweetheart. Boom.

1588
02:32:43.600 --> 02:32:44.965
Former mayor Dawn Bellwether
is behind bars today...

1589
02:32:45.600 --> 02:32:47.340
guilty of masterminding the savage attacks

1590
02:32:47.440 --> 02:32:49.568
that have plagued Zootopia of late.

1591
02:32:49.720 --> 02:32:53.281
Her predecessor, Leodore Lionheart,
denies any knowledge of her plot...

1592
02:32:53.440 --> 02:32:55.761
claiming he was just trying
to protect the city,

1593
02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:58.401
Did I falsely imprison those animals?

1594
02:32:58.560 --> 02:32:59.846
Well, yes. Yes, I did.

1595
02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:03.800
It was a classic "doing the wrong thing
for the right reason" kind of a deal.

1596
02:33:03.960 --> 02:33:06.860
In related news, doctors say
the Night Howler antidote

1597
02:33:06.960 --> 02:33:08.121
is proving effective...

1598
02:33:08.280 --> 02:33:11.124
in rehabilitating the afflicted predators.

1599
02:33:14.120 --> 02:33:15.201
Emmitt.

1600
02:33:17.120 --> 02:33:18.121
Emmitt.

1601
02:33:21.640 --> 02:33:22.687
Thank you.

1602
02:33:25.800 --> 02:33:27.484
When I was a kid...

1603
02:33:27.640 --> 02:33:31.281
I thought Zootopia was this perfect place.

1604
02:33:31.440 --> 02:33:35.809
Where everyone got along
and anyone could be anything.

1605
02:33:37.040 --> 02:33:40.123
Turns out, real life's a little bit
more complicated...

1606
02:33:40.280 --> 02:33:42.965
than a slogan on a bumper sticker.

1607
02:33:43.120 --> 02:33:44.804
Real life is messy

1608
02:33:46.680 --> 02:33:50.207
We all have limitations.
We all make mistakes.

1609
02:33:50.520 --> 02:33:54.844
Which means, hey, glass half-full,
we all have a lot in common.

1610
02:33:55.040 --> 02:33:57.850
And the more we try
to understand one another...

1611
02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:00.890
the more exceptional each of us will be.

1612
02:34:01.880 --> 02:34:03.803
But we have to try

1613
02:34:05.040 --> 02:34:07.611
So, no matter what type of animal
you are...

1614
02:34:07.800 --> 02:34:09.211
from the biggest elephant...

1615
02:34:10.200 --> 02:34:12.851
to our first fox...

1616
02:34:14.120 --> 02:34:18.170
I implore you... try

1617
02:34:18.280 --> 02:34:21.682
Try to make the world a better place.

1618
02:34:23.360 --> 02:34:24.361
Look inside yourself...

1619
02:34:24.480 --> 02:34:26.209
and recognize that change...

1620
02:34:27.040 --> 02:34:29.008
starts with you.

1621
02:34:30.400 --> 02:34:31.925
It starts with me.

1622
02:34:32.920 --> 02:34:36.208
It starts with all of us.

1623
02:34:44.440 --> 02:34:47.330
All right, enough! Shut it!

1624
02:34:47.560 --> 02:34:51.485
We have some new recruits
with us this morning...

1625
02:34:51.600 --> 02:34:52.761
including our first fox.

1626
02:34:53.560 --> 02:34:54.891
Who cares?

1627
02:34:55.040 --> 02:34:57.566
You should have your own line
of inspirational greeting cards, sir.

1628
02:34:57.720 --> 02:34:58.881
Shut your mouth, Wilde.

1629
02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:00.889
Assignments.

1630
02:35:01.040 --> 02:35:03.566
Officers Grizzoli, Fangmeyer, Delgato...

1631
02:35:03.760 --> 02:35:05.762
Tundratown SWAT.

1632
02:35:05.880 --> 02:35:07.928
Snarlov, Higgins, Wolfard...

1633
02:35:08.080 --> 02:35:10.082
undercover.

1634
02:35:10.240 --> 02:35:12.607
Hopps, Wilde.

1635
02:35:12.720 --> 02:35:14.210
Parking duty.

1636
02:35:14.320 --> 02:35:16.049
Dismissed.

1637
02:35:16.160 --> 02:35:18.083
Just kidding!

1638
02:35:18.240 --> 02:35:21.244
We have reports of a street racer
tearing up Savannah Central.

1639
02:35:21.960 --> 02:35:23.740
Find him, shut him down.

1640
02:35:23.840 --> 02:35:27.765
So, are all rabbits bad drivers,
or is it just you?

1641
02:35:30.040 --> 02:35:31.166
Oops. Sorry.

1642
02:35:32.960 --> 02:35:33.961
Sly bunny.

1643
02:35:34.160 --> 02:35:35.446
Dumb fox.

1644
02:35:35.600 --> 02:35:37.648
You know you love me.

1645
02:35:37.800 --> 02:35:39.450
Do I know that?

1646
02:35:39.600 --> 02:35:41.489
Yes. Yes, I do.

1647
02:35:56.160 --> 02:36:00.131
Sir, you were going 115 miles per hour.
I hope you have a good explanation.

1648
02:36:01.800 --> 02:36:02.801
Flash?

1649
02:36:02.960 --> 02:36:04.962
Flash? Hundred yard dash?

1650
02:36:08.480 --> 02:36:10.926
Nick.

1651
02:36:12.320 --> 02:36:14.540
Good evening, Zootopia!

1652
02:36:14.640 --> 02:36:18.008
Come on, everybody, put your paws up!

1653
02:36:18.160 --> 02:36:22.210
I messed up tonight
I lost another fight

1654
02:36:22.440 --> 02:36:25.842
Lost to myself
But I'll just start again

1655
02:36:26.040 --> 02:36:28.122
I keep falling down

1656
02:36:28.320 --> 02:36:30.448
I keep on hitting the ground

1657
02:36:30.680 --> 02:36:33.809
But I always get up now
To see what's next

1658
02:36:35.160 --> 02:36:38.403
I won't give up
No, I won't give in

1659
02:36:38.600 --> 02:36:42.605
Till I reach the end
And then I'll start again

1660
02:36:42.760 --> 02:36:47.004
No, I won't leave
I want to try everything

1661
02:36:47.160 --> 02:36:51.529
I want to try even though I could fail

1662
02:36:51.680 --> 02:36:55.002
I won't give up
No, I won't give in

1663
02:36:55.200 --> 02:36:59.410
Till I reach the end
Then I'll start again

1664
02:36:59.560 --> 02:37:03.531
No, I won't leave
I want to try everything

1665
02:37:03.680 --> 02:37:07.366
I want to try even though I could fail

1666
02:37:11.720 --> 02:37:13.210
Try everything

1667
02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:17.570
Try everything

1668
02:37:20.080 --> 02:37:21.605
Try everything

1669
02:37:25.920 --> 02:37:27.684
Put your paws in the air. Come on!

1670
02:37:33.680 --> 02:37:37.127
Look how far you've come
You filled your heart with love

1671
02:37:37.280 --> 02:37:41.285
Baby, you've done enough
Take a deep breath

1672
02:37:41.440 --> 02:37:45.445
Don't beat yourself up
No need to run so fast

1673
02:37:45.600 --> 02:37:49.924
Sometimes we come last
But we did our best

1674
02:37:50.080 --> 02:37:53.482
I won't give up
No, I won't give in

1675
02:37:53.760 --> 02:37:57.401
Till I reach the end
And then I'll start again

1676
02:37:57.600 --> 02:38:01.605
No, I won't leave
I want to try everything

1677
02:38:01.760 --> 02:38:03.330
I want to try

1678
02:38:03.600 --> 02:38:05.284
Even though I could fail

1679
02:38:06.720 --> 02:38:08.961
I won't give up No, I won't give in

1680
02:38:10.040 --> 02:38:14.090
Till I reach the end
Then I'll start again

1681
02:38:14.280 --> 02:38:18.490
No, I won't leave
I want to try everything

1682
02:38:18.640 --> 02:38:23.282
I want to try even though I could fail

1683
02:38:24.120 --> 02:38:31.288
I'll keep on making those new mistakes

1684
02:38:32.600 --> 02:38:39.961
And I'll keep on making them every day

1685
02:38:40.160 --> 02:38:44.688
Those new mistakes

1686
02:38:47.400 --> 02:38:49.084
Try everything

1687
02:38:51.520 --> 02:38:53.284
Try everything

1688
02:38:55.680 --> 02:38:57.330
Try everything

1689
02:39:05.720 --> 02:39:07.643
Come on!

1690
02:39:10.280 --> 02:39:11.770
Shake your tails with me. Come on!

1691
02:39:13.160 --> 02:39:14.241
Yeah!

1692
02:39:18.200 --> 02:39:22.000
I'll keep on making those new mistakes

1693
02:39:26.520 --> 02:39:33.244
I'll keep on making them every day

1694
02:39:34.480 --> 02:39:38.246
Those new mistakes

1695
02:39:41.360 --> 02:39:42.964
Try everything

1696
02:39:45.560 --> 02:39:47.085
Try everything

1697
02:39:49.720 --> 02:39:51.210
Try everything

1698
02:39:55.360 --> 02:39:59.001
Try everything
